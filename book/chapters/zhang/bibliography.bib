	abstract = {Overview
This repository is designed to model and calculate the temperature of railway brake discs using the Finite Element Method (FEM). The model incorporates heat transfer and elasticity equations to predict both temperature distribution and deformation in the brake disc during operation.

Methodology
The solution is based on the FEniCSx framework, which enables the efficient computation of coupled thermal and mechanical problems using FEM. This tool provides a powerful platform for solving complex partial differential equations, making it ideal for simulating the thermal and structural response of railway brake discs under operational loads.

	abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

	abstract = {This chapter highlights that the effect of coupling between metallic structures, including the molten state, temperature, and stress and/or strain occurring in processes accompanied by phase transformation, sometimes plays an important role in industrial processes. The chapter presents a method that simulates processes involving phase transformation when considering the effect of the coupling. Firstly, the formulation of the fundamental equations for stress–strain relationships, heat conduction, and transformation kinetics based on continuum thermodynamics will be carried out and then some examples of the numerical simulation of temperature, stress–strain, and metallic structures in some welding processes will be presented. Fundamental equations governing the temperature, stress, and metallic structural distributions in steel undergoing phase transformation have been developed when the coupling effect between them is taken into account and the procedure for solving the equations by the finite-element method has been presented. The theory was applied in order to simulate the welding process. The calculated results of the temperature, stress, and structural changes were compared with the experimentally measured data to confirm the validity of the simulation.},

	abstract = {In winter, some freight trains with composite brake blocks experience unexpected long braking distances, which seriously jeopardizes running safety. The reasons for the long braking distances are still not completely understood, and therefore it is difﬁcult to suggest preventive measures. Up to now, it has not really been studied how a layer of ice that is often found between the brake block and the wheel inﬂuences the braking process. To investigate whether ice inﬂuences the braking distance, a numerical model is built. Ice thickness, ambient temperature, initial speed, and axle load/brake pressure are parameters that can be varied in the model. Results are checked against available on-track tests. The simulation results show that ice signiﬁcantly inﬂuences the braking distance. The impact of ice on the braking distance increases when the ambient temperature, initial speed, and brake pressure are low, which is consistent with available ﬁeld test reports. The results also show that a conditioning brake, a high brake pressure and a small clearance between the wheel and brake block can efﬁciently reduce the impact of ice on the braking distance of freight trains with composite brake blocks in winter.},

If you want a brief but thorough education in numeric thinking about many of the fundamental forces that shape human life, this is the book to read. It's a tour de force' BILL GATES \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ We have never had so much information at our fingertips and yet most of us don't know how the world really works. This book explains seven of the most fundamental realities governing our survival and prosperity. From energy and food production, through our material world and its globalization, to risks, our environment and its future, How the World Really Works offers a much-needed reality check - because before we can tackle problems effectively, we must understand the facts. In this ambitious and thought-provoking book we see, for example, that globalization isn't inevitable and that our societies have been steadily increasing their dependence on fossil fuels, making their complete and rapid elimination unlikely. Drawing on the latest science and tackling sources of misinformation head on - from Yuval Noah Harari to Noam Chomsky - ultimately Smil answers the most profound question of our age: are we irrevocably doomed or is a brighter utopia ahead? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 'Very informative and eye-opening in many ways' HA-JOON CHANG, author of 23 Things They Don't Tell You About Capitalism  'If you are anxious about the future, and infuriated that we aren't doing enough about it, please read this book' PAUL COLLIER, author of The Future of Capitalism},

A ternary salt mixture comprising of potassium nitrate, sodium nitrate and sodium nitrite in the weight proportion of 53:7:40 is used as the phase change material (PCM) in the lab-scale LHS prototype. Hi-Tech Therm 60 is used as the heat transfer fluid (HTF). Performance parameters viz., melt fraction, charging/discharging time and energy storage/discharge rate were evaluated at different operating conditions. With the expertise and knowledge gained from the experimental and numerical investigations, the studies has been extended to develop an industrial-scale LHS system of 0.25 GJ capacity. A binary salt mixture comprising of sodium and potassium nitrate in the weight proportion of 60:40 is used as the PCM in the industrial-scale LHS module. The developed LHS module is then integrated with a commercial steam accumulator storage system of 1 GJ storage capacity. This combined storage system has been installed in the LFR based pilot-CSP plant in Vallipuram, Tamil Nadu, India.},

Security is “end-to-end” in the sense that the attacker can attack all parts of the system, including all communication links and any subset of parties (servers, devices, client terminals), can learn users’ passwords, and perform active and passive attacks, online and offline. In all cases the scheme provides the highest attainable security bounds given the set of compromised components. Our solution builds a TFA scheme using any Device-Enhanced PAKE, defined by Jarecki et al., and any Short Authenticated String (SAS) Message Authentication, defined by Vaudenay. We show an efficient instantiation the modular, generic construction we give is not PAKE-agnostic because it doesn’t even use PAKE, but the instantiation of this scheme which instantiates DE-PAKE with PTR+PAKE is PAKE-agnostic as you say of this modular construction which utilizes any password-based client-server authentication method, with or without reliance on public-key infrastructure. The security of the proposed scheme is proven in a formal model that we formulate as an extension of the traditional PAKE model.},

	abstract = {Text-based passwords are a fundamental and popular means of authentication. Password authentication can be simply implemented because it does not require any equipment, unlike biometric authentication, and it relies only on the users’ memory. This reliance on memory is a weakness of passwords, and people therefore usually use easy-to-remember passwords, such as “iloveyou1234”. However, these sample passwords are not difficult to crack. The default passwords of IoT also are text-based passwords and are easy to crack. This weakness enables free password cracking tools such as Hashcat and JtR to execute millions of cracking attempts per second. Finally, this weakness creates a security hole in networks by giving hackers access to an IoT device easily. Research has been conducted to better exploit weak passwords to improve password-cracking performance. The Markov model and probabilistic context-free-grammar (PCFG) are representative research results, and PassGAN, which uses generative adversarial networks (GANs), was recently introduced. These advanced password cracking techniques contribute to the development of better password strength checkers. We studied some methods of improving the performance of PassGAN, and developed two approaches for better password cracking: the first was changing the convolutional neural network (CNN)-based improved Wasserstein GAN (IWGAN) cost function to an RNN-based cost function; the second was employing the dual-discriminator GAN structure. In the password cracking performance experiments, our models showed 10–15\% better performance than PassGAN. Through additional performance experiments with PCFG, we identified the cracking performance advantages of PassGAN and our models over PCFG. Finally, we prove that our models enhanced password strength estimation through a comparison with zxcvbn.},

	abstract = {This work presents the development of an explicit/implicit particle ﬁnite element method (PFEM) for the 2D modeling of metal cutting processes. The purpose is to study the efﬁciency of implicit and explicit time integration schemes in terms of precision, accuracy and computing time. The formulation for implicit and explicit time marching schemes is developed, and a detailed study on the explicit solution steps is presented. The PFEM remeshing procedures for insertion and removal of particles have been improved to model the multiple scales of time and/or space of the solution. The detection and treatment of the rigid tool contact are presented for both, implicit and explicit schemes. The performance of explicit/implicit integration is studied with a set of different two-dimensional orthogonal cutting tests of AISI 4340 steel at cutting speeds ranging from 1 m/s up to 30 m/s. It was shown that if the correct selection of the time integration scheme is made, the computing time can decrease up to 40 times. It allows us to afﬁrm that the computing time of the PFEM simulations can be excessive due to the used time marching scheme independently of the meshing process. As a practical result, a set of recommendations to select the time integration schemes for a given cutting speed are given. This is intended to minimize one of the negative constraints pointed out by the industry when using metal cutting simulators.},

The detailed steps to realize the micromechanical FEM are discussed, and the improvement methods have been put forward. To provide an optimal process of the micromechanical FEM based on the general software, different boundary and post-processing conditions are used and compared. Based on the traditional homogenization theory, the multi-scale thermal–mechanical coupling asymptotic homogenization method has also been developed to predict the thermo-mechanical properties of the RVE model with introduced realization. To verify the theoretical method, the properties of the 2D woven ­SiCf/SiC were predicted using micromechanics FEM and multi-scale thermal–mechanical coupling method, and the experimental analysis was carried out to compare with the predict results. The two methods exhibit errors in predicting the inter-layer directional performance, while the performance in other directions varies only slightly.

A piecewise continuous time-step variation function is incorporated into the peridynamic framework that dynamically adjusts the time-step size, which ranges from a small value to a maximum value that remains below the critical stable time-step. The advantages of this variable timestep strategy are threefold: (1) The exceptional computational efficiency of this approach is mainly manifested in enabling peridynamic simulation that is 20 times faster compared to that employing a constant time step; (2) Taking advantage of the proposed method, both two- and three-dimensional per­ idynamic modeling of thermomechanical deformation and crack propagation has been demon­ strated to be of great accuracy and robustness; (3) Facilitated with this variable timestep strategy, we achieve a remarkable advancement in peridynamics to capture intricate 3D crack patterns with complex topological structures in homogeneous specimens subjected to water quenching. Furthermore, the effects of the temperature difference, specimen geometrical configurations and the initial water entry velocity on the crack patterns of the specimens under water quenching are systematically explored.},

	abstract = {In winter, some freight trains with composite brake blocks experience unexpected long braking distances, which seriously jeopardizes running safety. The reasons for the long braking distances are still not completely understood, and therefore it is difficult to suggest preventive measures. Up to now, it has not really been studied how a layer of ice that is often found between the brake block and the wheel influences the braking process. To investigate whether ice influences the braking distance, a numerical model is built. Ice thickness, ambient temperature, initial speed, and axle load/brake pressure are parameters that can be varied in the model. Results are checked against available on-track tests. The simulation results show that ice significantly influences the braking distance. The impact of ice on the braking distance increases when the ambient temperature, initial speed, and brake pressure are low, which is consistent with available field test reports. The results also show that a conditioning brake, a high brake pressure and a small clearance between the wheel and brake block can efficiently reduce the impact of ice on the braking distance of freight trains with composite brake blocks in winter.},

	abstract = {Results from full-scale tread braking experiments on an inertia dynamometer (brake testing machine) are presented. Eighteen prototypes of brake blocks are investigated. Two braking characteristics relating to the influence of the blocks on the wheel tread are studied: generation of hot spots and generation of roughness (corrugation, waviness). Wheel tread temperatures are measured during braking using an infrared (IR) technique. The wheel roughness is measured after each brake cycle when the wheel has cooled down. A roughness indicator, RλCA, relates measured roughness to expected rolling noise as generated by the wheel in operation. A correlation between the spatial distributions of temperatures and roughnesses is normally found: stronger for cast iron blocks and composition blocks and weaker for sinter blocks. The cast iron blocks are found to produce high tread roughness levels, partly owing to material transfer from brake block to wheel tread. The composition blocks are found to result in lower roughness levels than the cast iron blocks. Finally, the sinter metal blocks are found to lead to the lowest roughness levels, a fact which is probably due to the abrasive property of these blocks. Friction coefficients during braking are also measured. © IMechE 2000.},

The second problem is due to the multiscale aspect, from the macroscopic response of the disc and brake pads (conduction, distortions, etc.) to local surface effects (surface roughness, wear debris, phase changes, etc.). This paper aims to propose a macrostructural model of the thermomechanical behaviour of the disc brake, taking into account the real three-dimensional geometry of the disc-pad couple. Contact surface variations, distortions and wear are taken into account. Real body geometry and thermoelastoplastic modelling of the disc material are specially introduced. Such a model aims to give predictions of the thermal gradients varying with time and of the thermomechanical response of the components. Predictions of the temperature distributions are compared with experimental measurements obtained by thermographs and thermocouples. Such a model seems to be a suitable base for the study of the thermal dissipation and the thermomechanical behaviour and for the introduction of local friction effects.},

Alternative hot spot and cold zone were observed on the friction surface, which is attributed to the local contact in the friction couple and heterogeneous heat dissipation condition in the disc. The corresponding maximum temperature in the disc increased rapidly first, kept stable then, and decrease slowly in the end. The one-dimensional heat conduction equation was applied to predict the maximum temperature variation and was found to be in agreement with the experimental results. Furthermore, the maximum temperature evolution and the temperature distribution of the disc at the braking time of 45 s were simulated by the finite element method, which is satisfactory. In additional, the temperature variation caused the corresponding fluctuation of instantaneous frictional coefficient and thermal stress distribution in the disc, which results in the thermal damages.},

To obtain the transient stress/temperature fields of the brake under an emergency braking, the thermoelastic problem under this 3D model is solved by the finite element method. The numerical results from the analysis and simulation show the temperature/stress of the disk presenting periodic sharp fluctuation due to the continuous cyclic loading; its varying frequency corresponds to the rotated cycle times of the braking disk. The results demonstrate that the maximum surface equivalent stress may exceed the material yield strength during an emergency braking, which may cause a plastic damage accumulation in a brake disk, while a residual tensile hoop stress is incurred on cooling. These results are validated by experimental observation results available in the literature.

	abstract = {Ice formation and accretion may hinder the operation of many systems critical to national infrastructure, including airplanes, power lines, windmills, ships, and telecommunications equipment. Yet despite the pervasiveness of the icing problem, the fundamentals of ice adhesion have received relatively little attention in the scientific literature and it is not widely understood which attributes must be tuned to systematically design "icephobic" surfaces that are resistant to icing. Here we probe the relationships between advancing/receding water contact angles and the strength of ice adhesion to bare steel and twenty-one different test coatings (∼200-300 nm thick) applied to the nominally smooth steel discs. Contact angles are measured using a commercially available goniometer, whereas the average strengths of ice adhesion are evaluated with a custom-built laboratory-scale adhesion apparatus. The coatings investigated comprise commercially available polymers and fluorinated polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (fluorodecyl POSS), a low-surface-energy additive known to enhance liquid repellency. Ice adhesion strength correlates strongly with the practical work of adhesion required to remove a liquid water drop from each test surface (i.e., with the quantity [1 + cos θrec]), and the average strength of ice adhesion was reduced by as much as a factor of 4.2 when bare steel discs were coated with fluorodecyl POSS-containing materials. We argue that any further appreciable reduction in ice adhesion strength will require textured surfaces, as no known materials exhibit receding water contact angles on smooth/flat surfaces that are significantly above those reported here (i.e., the values of [1 + cos θrec] reported here have essentially reached a minimum for known materials). © 2010 American Chemical Society.},

	volume = {1},
	abstract = {The result of this test project is, without doubt, a clear indication of possible loss in brake efficiency when using composite brake shoes in winter conditions. Our hypothesis is that the lower thermal conductivity of the composite brake shoes makes them go much colder than the corresponding cast iron type of shoe. That will lead to a lack of de-icing capability and an unwanted ice build-up on and around the shoe. The problem is not present in all winter conditions as many factors are involved. One example of a specific situation is when the wheel, due to braking, has a temperature above freezing point while air, and brake shoes have a temperature below freezing point. That fact combined with heavy snow dust from the ground will rapidly cover the brake shoes with a layer of ice. In figure 25 is a photo showing how the situation can look like. Based on the complexity of the problem, it is very difficult to give any general number on how much the braking power will be reduced. In this report we have seen several cases where the composite brake blocks has a braking power in range of 40-70\% of the braking power given by traditional cast iron brake shoes. Another conclusion based on the tests is the difference between brake shoe friction in front and behind of the wheel. As the effect swaps when vehicle travel direction is swapped, we think it must have something to do with the wheel rotation. It also looks like the difference is reduced or even gone in dry weather conditions. Our hypothesis on this matter is that the wheel running surface picks up water, snow or even air with high humidity from rail/ground when the wheel rotates, see figure 26. The wet surface is always swiped by rear brake shoes and therefore the wheel surface is dry and clean when reaching the front brake shoe. We know from other tests that a (water-) wet rail or wheel metal surface can have half the friction coefficient compared to same surface in dry conditions.},

	abstract = {Braking is a process which converts a vehicle's kinetic energy into mechanical energy which must be dissipated in the form of heat. During the braking phase, the frictional heat generated at the interface of the disc and pads can lead to high temperatures. This phenomenon is even more important than the tangential stress. The relative sliding speeds during contact are also important. The prediction of surface temperature for a brake rotor is regarded as an important step in studying brake system performance. The frictional heat generated on the rotor surface can influence excessive temperature rise which, in turn, leads to undesirable effects such as thermal elastic instability (TEI), premature wear, brake fluid vaporization (BFV) and thermally excited vibrations (TEV). The objective of this study is to analyze the thermal behavior of the full and ventilated brake discs of the vehicles using computing code ANSYS. The modeling of the temperature distribution in the disc brake is used to identify all the factors and the entering parameters concerned at the time of the braking operation, such as the type of braking, the geometric design of the disc and the material used.

Current research focuses on conduction dominated heat transfer mechanism to increase the heat transfer performance. However, convection also has important effects on promoting PCM melting and solidification processes. Therefore, an active stirring method with conduction dominated heat transfer mechanism was studied. A shell storage with stirrer inside was constructed and tested. Paraffin was selected as the PCM; the heat transfer fluid (HTF) was water. The results show that average charging rate increased by 32.23 J/s than that without stirring, and the average discharging rate increased by 47.39 J/s. Completion time for charging/discharging with stirring was shortened by 9.61\% and 48.61\% than that without stirring. In the charging process, the average power of motor was 16.08W, and the average discharging rate was greater than 500 J/s, accounting for less than 3.2\%. In the discharging process, the average power consumption of the motor accounted for less than 5.2\% of the discharging rate.

When brakes are applied to stop the vehicle the brake pads come in contact with the brake disc which increases the temperature of the disc plate and is subjected to thermal stress. The main objective is to replace the currently used brake-pad material with a material that has enhanced properties and increases the life of the component. When sudden braking is applied forced stresses act on the disc brake and eventually there is a probability of the disc getting damaged. Thus, the static analysis is also taken into consideration which validates the ductility of the material.

Dynamometer test comprised emergency brake applications to determine the frictional characteristics of the materials and constant-power drag braking to analyse the effect of metal fibres on temperature evolution, measured by six thermocouples embedded in the brake disc. Mean friction coefficient is analysed and discussed. It is concluded that conductive fibre in the friction material formulation may influence its tribological characteristics. Despite high thermal conductivity, metal fibres in the concentration tested in this study, did not reduce temperature of the brake disc.},

In this present work, an attempt has been made to investigate the effect of stiffness, strength and variations in disc brake rotor design on the predicted stress and temperature distributions. By identifying the true design features, the extended service life and long term stability is assured. A transient thermal analysis has been carried out to investigate the temperature variation across the disc using axisymmetric elements. Further structural analysis is also carried out by coupling thermal analysis. An attempt is also made to suggest a best combination of material and flange width used for disc brake rotor, which yields a low temperature variation across the rotor, less deformation, and minimum vonmises stress possible.},

	abstract = {In a society characterised by increasing rates of urbanisation and growing concerns about environmental issues like climate change, urban rail transport plays a key role in contributing to sustainable development. However, in order to retain its inherent advantages in terms of energy consumption per transport capacity and to address the rising costs of energy, important energy efficiency measures have to be implemented. Given that numerous and frequent stops are a significant characteristic of urban rail, recuperation of braking energy offers a great potential to reduce energy consumption in urban rail systems. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the currently available strategies and technologies for recovery and management of braking energy in urban rail, covering timetable optimisation, on-board and wayside Energy Storage Systems (ESSs) and reversible substations. For each measure, an assessment of their main advantages and disadvantages is provided alongside a list of the most relevant scientific studies and demonstration projects. This study concludes that optimising timetables is a preferential measure to increase the benefits of regenerative braking in any urban rail system. Likewise, it has been observed that ESSs are a viable solution to reuse regenerative energy with voltage stabilisation and energy saving purposes. Electrochemical Double Layer Capacitors has been identified as the most suitable technology for ESSs in general, although high specific power batteries such as Li-ion may become a practical option for on-board applications in the near future. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that reversible substations are a feasible and commercially available technology, although their economic viability strongly depends on the ability to sell the excess regenerated energy to the public network operators for an appropriate price. Finally, it has been that a transfer of knowledge at international level between operators, manufacturers and other stakeholders is essential to achieve the great potential offered by regenerative braking, both in terms of energy efficiency, emissions reduction and system reliability. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Functions of unsteady air flows in the air brake pipes, the boundary conditions used in the air brake system, and the calculation method for pressures in the brake pipe, brake cylinder, and auxiliary air reservoir are discussed. A comparison of the simulation results with the experiment test results is made to verify the validity of the simulation. The results of the simulations, including long and short train with large and small pressure reduction service brake application, release, and emergency brake application, show good consistence with the experiment results on pressure change and its timing in the brake pipe, brake cylinder, and auxiliary reservoir, with the exception of long train at small pressure reduction application. This indicates that the simulation model can correctly predict the pressure behaviour of the unsteady air flows in the air brake system and component movements in the '120' control valve. The model can simulate braking characteristics of a freight train consisting of up to four locomotives. The simulation results can be used to successfully predict the braking distances and to assist longitudinal, dynamic, and impact force analyses of a train.

	abstract = {The braking phenomenon is an aspect of vehicle stopping performance where with kinetic energy due to the speed of the vehicle is transformed into thermal energy via the friction between the brake disk and its pads. The heat must then be dissipated into the surrounding structure and the airflow around the brake system. The frictional thermal field during the braking phase between the disk and the brake pads can lead to excessive temperatures. In our work, we presented numerical modeling using ANSYS software adapted in the finite element method, to follow the evolution of the global temperatures for the two types of brake disks, full and ventilated disk during braking scenario. Also, numerical simulation of the transient thermal and the static structural analysis were performed here sequentially, with coupled thermo-structural method. Numerical procedure of calculation relies on important steps such that the computational fluid dynamic (CFD) and thermal analysis have been well illustrated in 3D, showing the effects of heat distribution over the brake disk. This CFD approach helped in the calculation of the values of the heat transfer coefficients (h) that have been exploited in the 3D transient evolution of the brake disk temperatures. Three different brake disk materials were tested and comparative analysis of the results was conducted in order to derive the one with the best thermal behavior. The current numerical results were in good agreement with the previous experimental results available in literature. Finally, the resolution of the coupled thermomechanical model allows us to visualize other important results of this research, such as; the deformations, and the equivalent Von Mises stresses of the disk, as well as the contact pressure distribution on the brake pads. According to the results presented in this investigation, several conclusions can be drawn. The choice allowed us to deliver the excellent rotor design to ensure and guarantee the better braking performance of the vehicles.},

	abstract = {In this paper, an efficient sequential approach for simulating thermal stresses in brake discs for repeated braking is presented. First, a frictional heat analysis is performed by using an Eulerian formulation of the disc. Then, by using the temperature history from the first step of the sequence, a plasticity analysis with temperature dependent material data is performed in order to determine the corresponding thermal stresses. Three-dimensional geometries of a disc and a pad to a heavy truck are considered in the numerical simulations. The contact forces are computed at each time step taking the thermal deformations of the disc and pad into account. In such manner, the frictional heat power distribution will also be updated in each time step, which in turn will influence the development of heat bands. The plasticity model is taken to be the von Mises yield criterion with linear kinematic hardening, where both the hardening and the yield limit are temperature dependent. The results show that during hard braking, high compressive stresses are generated on the disc surface in the circumferential direction which cause yielding. But when the disc cools down, these compressive stresses transform to tensile residual stresses. For repeated hard braking when this kind of stress history is repeated, we also show that stress cycles with high amplitudes are developed which might generate low cycle fatigue cracks after a few braking cycles. © IMechE 2013.},

	abstract = {Non-exhaust emissions (NEE) of particulate matter (PM) from brake, tyre, road pavement and railway wear, as well as resuspension of already deposited road dust, account for up to 90\% by mass of total traffic-related PM emitted. This review aims at analysing the current knowledge on road traffic NEE regarding sources, particle generation processes, chemical and physical characterization, and mitigation strategies. The literature on this matter often presents highly variable and hardly comparable results due to the heterogeneity of NEE sources and the absence of standardized sampling and measurement protocols. As evidence, emission factors (EFs) were found to range from 1 mg km−1 veh−1 to 18.5 mg km−1 veh−1 for brake wear, and from 0.3 mg km−1 veh−1 to 7.4 mg km−1 veh−1 for tyre wear. Resuspended dust, which varies in even wider ranges (from 5.4 mg km−1 veh−1 to 330 mg km−1 veh−1 for cars), is considered the prevailing NEE source. The lack of standardized monitoring approaches resulted in the impossibility of setting international regulations to limit NEE. Therefore, up until now the abatement of NEE has only been achieved by mitigation and prevention strategies. However, the effectiveness of these measures still needs to be improved and further investigated. As an example, mitigation strategies, such as street washing or sweeping, proved effective in reducing PM levels, but only in the short term. The replacement of internal combustion engines vehicles with electric ones was instead proposed as a prevention strategy, but there are still concerns regarding the increase of NEE deriving from the extra weight of the batteries. The data reported in this review highlighted the need for future studies to broaden their research area, and to focus not only on the standardization of methods and the introduction of regulations, but also on improving already existing technologies and mitigating strategies.},

	abstract = {In this study, the sources of uncertainty of hot-wire anemometry (HWA) and oil-film interferometry (OFI) measurements are assessed. Both statistical and classical methods are used for the forward and inverse problems, so that the contributions to the overall uncertainty of the measured quantities can be evaluated. The correlations between the parameters are taken into account through the Bayesian inference with error-in-variable (EiV) model. In the forward problem, very small differences were found when using Monte Carlo (MC), Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE) and linear perturbation methods. In flow velocity measurements with HWA, the results indicate that the estimated uncertainty is lower when the correlations among parameters are considered, than when they are not taken into account. Moreover, global sensitivity analyses with Sobol indices showed that the HWA measurements are most sensitive to the wire voltage, and in the case of OFI the most sensitive factor is the calculation of fringe velocity. The relative errors in wall-shear stress, friction velocity and viscous length are 0.44\%, 0.23\% and0.22\%, respectively. Note that these values are lower than the ones reported in other wall-bounded turbulence studies. Note that in most studies of wall-bounded turbulence the correlations among parameters are not considered, and the uncertainties from the various parameters are directly added when determining the overall uncertainty of the measured quantity. In the present analysis we account for these correlations, which may lead to a lower overall uncertainty estimate due to error cancellation Furthermore, our results also indicate that the crucial aspect when obtaining accurate inner-scaled velocity measurements is the wind-tunnel flow quality, which is more critical than the accuracy in wall-shear stress measurements.},

	abstract = {In sliding contact, conditions such as pressure and temperature are affected by geometry as well as by material properties and boundary conditions. Simulations have been performed to investigate the effects of material properties and geometry on pressure and temperature. In addition, a favourable set of material parameters has been obtained using an optimisation method called multilevel coordinate search (MCS). The design parameters were found to affect the contact conditions to varying degrees. The ones that were found to have the most significant effect on contact temperature were the coefficient of friction, and specific heat. The pressure, on the other hand, is most affected by thermal expansion and the coefficient of wear. Assessing the effects that different parameters may have on the contact pressure and temperature of sliding bodies has become increasingly important, due to constantly increasing demands on brake performance. The thermal aspects of a friction couple then play an important role, and are often a restricting factor for the braking capabilities of a system. More specifically, a thermoelastic instability (TEI) phenomenon is believed to be the driving force in terms of excessive pressure and temperature. TEI in friction material appears as slowly moving contact points. The cause of this is an interaction between wear and thermal expansion. Moreover, in this paper the sliding material has been modelled as a smooth, but thermally conductive rigid surface. A continuum thermomechanical model was used to calculate the interface pressure and temperature. The model incorporates temperature dependent variables, such as friction and wear. The thermomechanical model was discretized with finite elements, and Newton method was used to solve the resulting system of equations. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

For convective cooling, heat transfer coefficients were measured and very similar results were obtained from spin rig experiments and CFD analyses. The nature of radiative heat dissipation implies substantial effects at high temperatures. The results indicate substantial change of emissivity throughout the brake application.

It uses a screw heat exchanger (SHE) for the phase change during the transport of a phase change material (PCM) from a cold to a hot tank or vice versa. This separates heat transfer and storage tank in comparison to existing concepts. A test rig has been built in order to investigate the heat transfer coefficients of the SHE during melting and crystallization of the PCM. The knowledge of these characteristics is crucial in order to assess the performance of the latent heat storage in a thermal system. The test rig contains a double shafted SHE, which is heated or cooled with thermal oil. The overall heat transfer coefficient U and the convective heat transfer coefficient on the PCM side hPCM both for charging and discharging have been calculated based on the measured data. For charging, the overall heat transfer coefficient in the tested SHE was Uch = 308 W/m2K and for discharging Udis = 210 W/m2K. Based on the values for hPCM the overall heat transfer coefficients for a larger SHE with steam as heat transfer fluid and an optimized geometry were calculated with Uch = 320 W/m2K for charging and Udis = 243 W/m2K for discharging. For pressures as high as p = 100 bar, an SHE concept has been developed, which uses an organic fluid inside the flight of the SHE as working media. With this concept, the SHE can also be deployed for very high pressure, e.g. as storage in solar thermal power plants.},

	abstract = {One of the primary interests in the railway field is to improve speed as well as to secure the safety of railway vehicles at a high speed. In light of this, the demand for braking systems that offer improved performance and safety has also been growing consistently. The braking system is a critical element directly connected with safety. In order to secure reliability and establish the maintenance standard for the braking system, it is necessary to secure an accurate evaluation technology. As the braking disc of the braking system is very sensitive to safety and maintenance, a method to evaluate thermal cracking must be developed. Because the brake disc goes through a repeated process of heating and cooling due to the friction energy and the heat convection, respectively, in every braking action, it is subject to thermal fatigue. As well, the partial contact area caused by friction between disc and pad during the braking process results in thermal distortion, causing a hot band and a hot spot. This thermal distortion may also cause thermal cracking on the friction surface. The aim of this research was to find the cause of thermal cracking through a thermo-mechanical friction analysis of disc and pad, and to verify the analysis model through the dynamo machine.},

	abstract = {Thermo-mechanical coupled systems are typically complex, however, the demand for analyses of this kind of multi-physics system is increasing, for example, accurately predicting the temperature and thermal stress of the railway disc brakes. However, many models ignore the phenomenon of thermal expansion and wear on brake pads. Therefore, their influence on the result is unclear. This research aims to investigate the effect of these two phenomena on the temperatures and stresses. These influences represent different heat flux input methods. Based on the finite element method (FEM), a three-dimensional (3D) transient thermo-mechanical model is built up. Three cases with or without thermal expansion and wear are conducted. The model is validated against measurement data. Simulation results show that thermal expansion and wear on the brake pads cause a 10\% difference in the average temperatures of the brake discs, while a 257\% difference in the maximum temperatures. As for the equivalent stresses (Von Mises stress), the difference can reach 3500\%. Overall, this research builds a thermo-mechanical model and quantifies the effects of thermal expansion and wear on the temperatures and stresses of railway brake discs. The model can be transferred to other thermo-mechanical coupled multi-physics systems.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

	abstract = {Increased demand for shorter travel times, higher axle loads, increased volumes and increased punctuality of railway traffic calls for a better design and management of the railway subsystems. The present thesis deals with aspects of mechanical friction brakes, in the form of tread brakes and disc brakes. These are critical for reliable, safe and economical operation of trains. The thesis establishes models and simulation tools for frictional braking systems that may operate in parallel with an electrodynamic braking system. A main focus is the influence of thermal loading on rolling contact fatigue from tread brakes at stop braking. A simulation methodology for thermomechanical cracking of railway wheel treads due to rolling contact and repeated stop braking by tread brakes, is established based on full-scale brake rig experiments. Building on the same approach, plastic deformation of the tread is also investigated. The results indicate that tread damage increases drastically for frictional temperatures above some 450 ºC. Another focus is temperatures and wear of tread brakes and disc brakes under operational loading. In two field test campaigns, detailed instrumentation and continuous measurements of relevant temperatures and braking parameters are combined with intermittent measurement of wear of friction brake components. Wear of brake blocks and wheel treads is quantified. It is found that the tread wear introduced by the block contact dominates for trailing wheelsets, whereas for powered wheelsets wear from tractive forces in the wheel–rail contact can be of equal importance. In a study on disc brakes, temperatures and wear performance are compared for two friction pairs: one new segmented disc with sintered pads and a traditional disc with an undivided friction ring combined with organic pads. It is found that the discs have similar braking temperatures, but that the wear of disc and pads is substantially lower for the segmented disc. A numerical investigation of thermomechanical fatigue damage of the two disc types indicates that the segmented disc also has a substantially longer fatigue life.},

	abstract = {The article presents a fully coupled 3D thermomechanical model of a railway vehicle disc brake for calculations of temperature, stress, contact pressure and wear distributions. Five specially designed composite organic friction materials associated with a cast-iron ventilated brake disc were analyzed. The performed computer simulations correspond to the operational parameters of braking carried out on a full scale dynamometer test stand at constant braking power and constant vehicle velocity. These conditions were obtained by correcting the clamping force in relation to changes in the coefficient of friction. In the finite element (FE) model of the disc brake, the pad wear depth distribution was determined on the basis of the Archard’s law taking into account the specific wear rate, contact pressure and sliding velocity. To create the numerical model with the geometry deformation allowing for friction material loss due to wear, advanced techniques were adapted. The geometric model of the brake includes the complex shapes of the brake pad holder, brake pad and ventilated disc. The wear constants of the tested friction material were obtained by means of the FE simulation and the measurement of the pad weight loss before and after the test on a full scale dynamometer test stand. The distributions of temperature, stresses, contact pressure and accumulated wear depth, obtained from the finite element analysis, in combination with the measured changes in the clamping force and coefficient of friction during braking, enabled to establish relationships between the properties of materials, operational parameters of braking and geometrical features of the brake components.},

This combined loading problem requires simulation using coupled thermo-mechanical analysis for design evaluation. This work presents a combined thermal and mechanical finite element analysis and evolutionary optimization-based novel approach for estimating the optimal design parameters of the ventilated brake disc. Five parameters controlling the design: Inboard plate thickness, outboard plate thickness, vane height, effective offset, and center hole radius were considered, and simulation runs were planned. 27 brake disc designs with design parameters as recommended by the Taguchi method (L27) were modeled using SOLIDWORKS, and the FEA simulation runs were carried out using ANSYS thermal \& structural analysis tool. The fatigue life results were analyzed using a 3D surface plot for the effect of the design parameters on the response, contour plots for the determination of maximum response, and statistical regression analysis for model interpretation and predictive modeling. Finally, the two most accurate and widely used evolutionary optimization algorithms: genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) were applied to determine the optimal design parameters for the ventilated brake disc. The brake disc of design parameters predicted by GA and (PSO), gives 12.74\% higher fatigue life compared to parametric analysis. These results have shown that the developed approach can be utilized effectively and reliably for solving, design ventilated brake disc problem in the industry.},

The conclusions of the paper show that the construction of brake pads significantly influences noise emission, noise negatively influences on the people health, and because of the negative influence on the people health, some solutions show that it is necessary to include insulators in the construction of brake pads, and if the space in which people reside is observed, it is necessary during construction to use materials which will prevent noise conduction, into the space in which people reside.},

	abstract = {For achieving the desired vehicle speed, the IC engine is very important, while for further vehicle speed maintaining and adaptation to road conditions, the braking system is important. With each brake’s activation, wear products are forming, which are very harmful to the environment, because they can contain heavy metals. The braking working parameters (initial speed and braking pressure) are beside the achieved temperature in contact par, the most responsible, for particle formation and their release into the air. The particles forming can be divided by size on coarse, fine, and ultrafine particles, and which were observed in the paper. However, the greatest accent was placed on coarse and fine particles. For the determination of the composition of wear products, most often, laboratory tests were used. Particle composition greatly depends on the composition of brake pads, which can consist of about 30 components, and where some of these components have very unfavourable effects on people’s health. So today, many researches are focused on finding such composition for brake pads, which will wear as less as possible, without disturbing the basic tribological properties. The conclusion of this paper shows that the applied materials for manufacturing the braking system are very important, as well as the construction, for the reduction of particle emission.},

In view to this, a parking brake model that takes into account the temperature reduction of the drum brake has to be developed and more importantly, it must comply with the applicable standards or regulations such as Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) 135. This paper develops a one dimensional (1D) model of leadingtrailing drum-type parking brake model. This brake model is then veriﬁed with experiments carried out on a test bench that has been veriﬁed with the hand brake system in the vehicle. The results from the experiments show a good correlation with the predicted results from the brake model. It is also found that the existing parking brake design meets the standard requirements. Another ﬁnding is that the brake torque slightly increases as the drum temperature increases. With the veriﬁed brake model, parametric studies can be carried out as one of the tools during the design process. From the studies, it is found that rollaway will not happen even with the maximum vehicle weight and friction coefﬁcient at drum/lining interface above 0.2.},

	abstract = {The interpretation of certain phenomena occuring at nominally flat surfaces in stationary or sliding contact is dependent on the assumed distribution of the real area of contact between the surfaces. Since there is little direct evidence on which to base an estimate of this distribution, the approach used is to set up a simple model and compare the deduced theory (e.g., the deduced dependence of the experimental observables on the load) with the experimental evidence. The main conclusions are as follows. (a) The electrical contact resistance depends on the model used to represent the surfaces; the most realistic model is one in which increasing the load increases both the number and size of the contact areas. (b) In general, mechanical wear should also depend on the model. However, in wear experiments showing the simplest behavior, the wear rate is proportional to the load, and these results can be explained by assuming removal of lumps at contact areas formed by plastic deformation; moreover, this particular deduction is independent of the assumed model. This suggests that a basic assumption of previous theories, that increasing the load increases the number of contacts without affecting their average size, is redundant.},

	abstract = {Friction heating during braking may causes premature wear, thermal cracks and other damages which could weak the braking performance of subway vehicles. It is therefore important to determine the temperature field of the brake disc. The purpose of this paper is to propose a onedimensional brake disc model and apply a new solution algorithm to obtain the temperature field of the brake disc, which is validated by the Renk Dynamometer test bench. The advantage of this numerical model is that the variable friction coefficient and slope are taken into account. The experimental dependency of the coefficient of friction on the velocity is approximated by inter­ polation and applied to the numerical model. The calculation is based on two cases of constant and velocity-dependent friction coefficient (COF) by using the method of lines (MOL), which has the advantage of shorter computation time and improved accuracy. The numerical results agree well with the experimental data. It was proved that disregarding the velocity dependence of the coefficient of friction, the maximum temperature during the entire braking process was under­ estimated by 15\%. In addition, the subway vehicle braking on slope should decrease the speed limit appropriately to reduce the maximum temperature of the brake disc. This study can provide a theoretical basis for further fatigue study of brake discs.},

The first is strong coupling: it uses finite elements with all degrees of freedom necessary for an electro-thermo-mechanical study. The second is weak coupling which consists of decoupling the three physical phenomena by using a sequential calculation. This method is applied in two scenarios. The first is an electronic board of an engine control unit. The second is a radar power amplifier. To understand the mechanical behavior of the electronic board, it is necessary to model several physical phenomena.

A semi-empirical model describing the correlation of coefficient of friction (COF) and temperature was presented. The effectiveness of the model was evaluated using the experimental data. The results revealed that the model parameters for a given composite show a significant change above a critical sliding velocity, i.e. 300 rpm. This behavior was speculated to be due to the transition of rubbery state of the matrix to glassy behavior caused by the viscoelastic response of the RBFMs. The experimental data revealed that such rubber-to-glass transition influences significantly the fade behavior and wear rate of the RBFMs. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We demonstrate HFM for several physical and biomedical problems by extracting quantitative information for which direct measurements may not be possible.

	abstract = {Background: In the past, fires around railways were often associated with steam locomotives. Although steam locomotives have disappeared from everyday rail traffic, fires still occur. A vegetation fire near Bzenec (Czech Republic) on 21 June 2018 affected, for example, 124,110 m2 of forest and grassland. The investigation revealed that the fire was caused by a spark from a passing train. In this study, we analyzed vegetation fires that occurred near Czech railway lines between 2011 and 2019 to investigate their temporal pattern and relation to weather conditions or to identify the most hazardous locations. Results: Fires were concentrated mainly between March and August in the afternoon. They are also more likely to occur during periods of high air temperature, low rainfall, low relative air humidity, and low wind speed. Using the KDE+ method, we identified 186 hotspots, which contained 510 vegetation fires and represented only 0.3\% of the length of the entire Czech rail network. Spatial analysis revealed that there are more than 4 times higher odds that a vegetation fire occurs near an electrified railway line than near a non-electrified line or that additional 10 freight trains per 24 h increases the odds by 5\%. Conclusions: As the results show, vegetation fires near railway lines are still relatively common phenomenon, mainly due to favorable weather conditions. Grassy areas with dry or dead vegetation are particularly at risk. These areas can be ignited, for example, by sparks from the brakes of railway vehicles. Due to global warming, vegetation fires can be expected to occur more frequently in the future. The identified hotspots can thus be used to reduce the risk of fires, for example by managing the surrounding vegetation.},

These additive materials include Cu-based powder metallurgy material, composite material, and a Mn–Cu damping alloy. The results indicate that the filling materials significantly influence the wear behavior of a braking interface and the characteristics of friction-induced vibration. Under the same experimental conditions, the perforated blocks filled with different materials produce different types of wear debris and exhibit different wear evolutions, markedly changing the wear debris distribution and surface morphology. These changes lead to variations in thermal distribution on the surfaces of both the friction block and brake disc. The study also shows that as a filling material, the Mn–Cu damping alloy can suppress the friction-induced vibration of the brake system, resulting in the lowest level of brake noise among all brake systems. However, the original friction block (i.e., the block without any filling material) can trap wear debris because of its perforated structure. The structure produces less friction-induced vibration and noise, compared with the block filled with powder metallurgy material. The noise performance of the composite material block is superior to the noise performance of the block without any filling material (i.e., the original block) and the block with powder metallurgy material but inferior to that of the block filled with the Mn–Cu damping alloy. Finite element analysis indicates that the properties of the filling materials exert no effect on the unstable vibration intensity of the brake system. Therefore, the wear debris behavior of the filling materials and the interface wear characteristics influence the friction-induced vibration and noise of the brake system.},

	abstract = {A thermal model of railway tread braking is developed for use in routine calculations of wheel and brake block temperatures. Two-dimensional finite-element models of block(s) and wheel are coupled via a contact interface that controls the heat generation and also the heat partitioning between block and wheel through thermal contact resistances. The surface temperature variations around the wheel circumference as caused by frictional heating and intermediate cooling are accounted for in a mean sense, assuming high-speed sliding conditions. The thermal power generated at the block-wheel interface during braking is determined from train braking data. A model for heat transfer from the rolling wheel into the rail is developed where a film with thermal contact resistance is placed at the wheel-rail contact interface. The present model can be used to efficiently design tread braking systems for both freight and passenger trains. It can handle stop braking, drag braking at constant brake power, and also intermediate periods of cooling. The temperature history during a full train route can be calculated. The inclusion of heat transfer from wheel to rail means that the model is useful for comparing brake rig tests, where normally the chilling influence from the rail is not included, with in-field tests. Two companion papers with experimental results supplement the present numerical modelling. A brief numerical example demonstrates the heat partitioning and the influence of rail chill (about 30 per cent) for two braking configurations. JRRT57 © IMechE 2007.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to clarify the relationship between the coefficient of friction (COF) and temperature of aluminum-based brake discs. Design/methodology/approach: Three friction blocks with different COFs are examined by a TM-I-type reduced-scale inertial braking dynamometer. On this basis, the thermo-mechanically coupled model of friction pairs is established to study the evolution of brake disc temperature under different COFs using ADINA software. Findings: Results indicate that the calculated disc temperature field matches the experimental well. The effect of COF on the peak temperature is magnified by the braking speed. With the COF increasing, the rise rate of instantaneous peak temperature is accelerated, and the dynamic equilibrium period and cooling-down period are observed in advance. The increase in COF promotes the area ratio of the high-temperature zone and the maximum radial temperature difference. When the COF is increased from 0.245 to 0.359 and 0.434 at 140 km/h, the area ratio of high-temperature zone increases from 12\% to 44\% and 49\% and the maximum radial temperature difference increases from 56°C to 75°C and 83°C. The sensitiveness of the axial temperature difference to the COF is related to the braking time. The maximum axial temperature difference increases with COF in the early stages of braking, while it is hardly sensitive to the COF in the later stages of braking. Originality/value: The effect of COF on the aluminum-based brake disc temperature is revealed, providing a theoretical reference for the popularization of aluminum-based brake discs and the selection of matching brake pads.},

Design/methodology/approach: The braking performances of resin materials (RM), semimetallic materials (SM) and copper-based powder metallurgy materials (PM) friction blocks mating with forged steel brake disc were examined based on TM-I-type reduced-scale inertial braking dynamometer. The brake disc surface temperature was recorded by infrared thermal camera during braking. Findings: Experimental results indicate that the thermal wear resistance of three friction materials differs with mental content, resulting in the deviation of pad-disc system contact state during braking, thus forming different temperature distribution on the brake disc surface. The peak temperature on the disc face of RM (190°C) is 36.6\% and 45.4\% lower than that of PM (300°C) and SM (348°C) at 160 km/h. The maximum radial temperature deviation of PM (35°C) is approximately three times than that of RM (12°C) and 40\% higher than that of SM (25°C) at 50 km/h, whereas the maximum temperature deviation of SM (97°C) is six times than that of RM (16°C) and 31\% higher than that of PM (74°C) at 160 km/h.

	doi = {10.1051/meca/2023016},
	abstract = {Brake wear has been identified to be an important source of non-exhaust emissions in transportation. The high dissipated energy in the contact not only results in large frictional heat dissipation in the brake components but also in the generation of debris, particles and gases produced by the wear of both pads and disc. Numerical simulation or tribological tests at the material scale are still not sufficient to predict wear. Experiments at the original scale of the brake system are necessary, with a significant implementation time, high costs and with a limited scope. The aim of the present work is a downscaling strategy to design experiments at reduced scale (i.e. pin-on-disc tribometer scale) taking care of the thermomechanical characteristics of the full-scale braking situation in the case of a railway application. This approach requires a complete understanding of the thermomechanical processes occurring during braking, with respect to the contact loading, the thermal localizations (migrating hot bands), the kinematics of contact opening and closing, and the couplings with the tribological circuit and the wear processes. Their apprehension is based on tests carried out on a full-scale bench equipped with the studied railway brake. A numerical model has been developed to interpret the experiment with respect to the kinetics of contact location and opening-closing, and to identify the relative determinants, key to wear. The transposition of the brake configuration to the tribometer configuration is based on these determinants in the design of a wear-preserving tribosystem. For example, the design of the disc has been adjusted on the reduced scale pin-on-disc system to fit with the kinetical parameters of contact location previously described related to the wear determinants.},

The results illustrate that this co-simulation method has good capacity in providing cooling effect and temperature predictions. It also shows that the data exchange between the FEM and CFD codes at every time increment is highly accurate and efficient throughout 10 brake applications. It can be seen that the co- simulation method is more time efficient, convenient and robust compared to previous one- way coupling methods.

After an offline training based on data from both regimes, DeepONet can make accurate predictions of bubble growth on-The-fly (within a fraction of a second) across four orders of magnitude difference in spatial scales and two orders of magnitude in temporal scales.

	title = {Commission proposes new {Euro} 7 standards to reduce pollutant emissions from vehicles and improve air quality},
	url = {https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_22_6495},
	abstract = {Commission proposes new Euro 7 standards to reduce pollutant emissions from vehicles and improve air quality Brussels, 10 November 2022 Today, the Commission presented a proposal to reduce air pollution from new motor vehicles sold in the EU to meet the European Green Deal's zero-pollution ambition, while keeping vehicles affordable for consumers and promoting Europe's competitiveness. Road transport is the largest source of air pollution in cities. The new Euro 7 standards will ensure cleaner vehicles on our roads and improved air quality, protecting the health of our citizens and the environment. Euro 7 standards and CO 2 emission standards for vehicles work hand-in-hand to deliver air quality for citizens, as notably the increased uptake of electric vehicles also creates certain air quality benefits. The two sets of rules give the automotive supply chain a clear direction for reducing pollutant emissions, including using digital technologies. The new Euro 7 emission standards will ensure that cars, vans, lorries and buses are much cleaner, in real driving conditions that better reflect the situation in cities where air pollution problems are largest, and for a much longer period than under current rules. The proposal tackles emissions from tailpipes as well as from brakes and tyres. It also contributes to achieving the new stricter air quality standards proposed by the Commission on 26 October 2022. While CO 2 emission rules will drive the deployment of zero-emission vehicles, it is important to ensure that all vehicles on our roads are much cleaner. In 2035, all cars and vans sold in the EU will have zero CO 2-emissions. However, in 2050, more than 20\% of cars and vans and more than half of the heavier vehicles in our streets are expected to continue to emit pollutants from the tailpipe. Battery electric vehicles also still cause pollution from brakes and microplastics from tyres. Euro 7 rules will reduce all these emissions and keep vehicles affordable to consumers. The new requirements based on the Euro 7 standards: The proposal replaces and simplifies previously separate emission rules for cars and vans (Euro 6) and lorries and buses (Euro VI). The Euro 7 standards rules bring emission limits for all motor vehicles, i.e., cars, vans, buses and lorries under a single set of rules. The new rules are fuel-and technology-neutral, placing the same limits regardless of whether the vehicle uses petrol, diesel, electric drive-trains or alternative fuels. They will help to: Better control emissions of air pollutants from all new vehicles: by broadening the range of driving conditions that are covered by the on-road emissions tests. These will now better reflect the range of conditions that vehicles can experience across Europe, including temperatures of up to 45°C or short trips typical of daily commutes. Update and tighten the limits for pollutant emissions: limits will be tightened for lorries and buses while the lowest existing limits for cars and vans will now apply regardless of the fuel used by the vehicle. The new rules also set emission limits for previously unregulated pollutants, such as nitrous oxide emissions from heavy-duty vehicles. Regulate emissions from brakes and tyres: the Euro 7 standards rules will be the first worldwide emission standards to move beyond regulating exhaust pipe emissions and set additional limits for particulate emissions from brakes and rules on microplastic emissions from tyres. These rules will apply to all vehicles, including electric ones. Ensure that new cars stay clean for longer: all vehicles will need to comply with the rules for a longer period than until now. Compliance for cars and vans will be checked until these vehicles reach 200,000 kilometres and 10 years of age. This doubles the durability requirements existing under Euro 6/VI rules (100,000 kilometres and 5 years of age). Similar increases will take place for buses and lorries. Support the deployment of electric vehicles: the new rules will regulate the durability of batteries installed in cars and vans in order to increase consumer confidence in electric vehicles. This will also reduce the need for replacing batteries early in the life of a vehicle, thus reducing the need for new critical raw materials required to produce batteries. Make full use of digital possibilities: Euro 7 rules will ensure that vehicles are not tampered with and emissions can be controlled by the authorities in an easy way by using sensors inside the vehicle to measure emissions throughout the lifetime of a vehicle.},

This study attempted to examine the effect of PM10 emissions derived from the construction of a rail transit system in an urban street canyon. Using a 3D computational fluid dynamic (CFD) model based on a real street canyon with different height ratios, this study formulates the impact of height ratio and wind directions on the dispersion and concentration of PM10. The results indicate that parallel flow would cause the concentration of PM10 at the end of the street canyons in all height ratios, and the trends in horizontal, vertical and lateral planes in all street canyons are similar. While in the condition of perpendicular flow, double-eddy circulations occur and lead to the concentration of PM10 in the middle part of the street canyon and leeward of backwind buildings in all height ratios. Furthermore, perpendicular flow will cause the concentration of PM10 to increase if the upwind buildings are higher than the backwind ones. This study also shows that the dispersion of PM10 is strongly associated with wind direction in and the height ratios of the street canyons. Certain measures could, therefore, be taken to prevent the impact on people in terms of the PM10 concentration and the heights of street canyons identified in this research. Potential mitigation strategies are suggested, include measurements below 4 m according to governmental regulations, dust shields, and atomized water.},

	abstract = {Hot spotting is a thermal localisation phenomenon in which multiple hot regions form on a brake disc surface during high-energy and/or high-speed braking events. As an undesired problem, hot spots can result in high-order brake judder, an audible droning noise and thermal cracking. This paper presents a finite element model for hot-spot modelling which introduces the classical axisymmetric assumptions to the brake pad in three dimensions by scaling the material properties combined with a subroutine to simulate the heat generation instead of modelling the rotation of the brake pad. The results from the initial feasibility models showed significant improvement in the computing efficiency with acceptable accuracy when compared with a traditional finite element model without such simplifications. This method was then applied to three-dimensional simulations of hot spotting on a realistic ventilated brake disc–pad pair, and the results showed good correlation with the experiments. In order to improve the understanding of the hot-spotting mechanism, parametric studies were performed including the effects of a solid-disc geometry and a ventilated-disc geometry, the rotational speed and energy, the pins, the disc run-out and the brake pad length. Based on the analysis of the results, it was identified that the vents and the pins affected the hot-spot distribution. The speed was shown to be more important in the hot-spot generation time and the hot-spot distribution than either the pressure or the total energy input was. The brake disc run-out was shown to affect the magnitude of both the hot-spot temperature and the hot-spot height because of the non-linear relationship between the local deformation, the contact pressure and the heat generation. Finally, increasing the brake pad length generated fewer hot spots, but the temperature of each hot spot increased.},

Wheel, track, and brake abrasion are the primary sources of particulate matter, producing predominantly Fe-rich particles that make the LU microenvironment particularly well suited to study using environmental magnetism. Here we combine magnetic properties, high-resolution electron microscopy, and electron tomography to characterize the structure, chemistry, and morphometric properties of LU particles in three dimensions with nanoscale resolution. Our findings show that LU PM is dominated by 5–500 nm particles of maghemite, occurring as 0.1–2 μm aggregated clusters, skewing the size-fractioned concentration of PM artificially to larger sizes when measured with traditional monitors. Magnetic properties are largely independent of the PM filter size (PM10, PM4, and PM2.5), and demonstrate the presence of superparamagnetic ({\textless} 30 nm), single-domain (30–70 nm), and vortex/pseudo-single domain (70–700 nm) signals only (i.e., no multi-domain particles {\textgreater} 1 µm). The oxidized nature of the particles suggests that PM exposure in the LU is dominated by resuspension of aged dust particles relative to freshly abraded, metallic particles from the wheel/track/brake system, suggesting that periodic removal of accumulated dust from underground tunnels might provide a cost-effective strategy for reducing exposure. The abundance of ultrafine particles identified here could have particularly adverse health impacts as their smaller size makes it possible to pass from lungs to the blood stream. Magnetic methods are shown to provide an accurate assessment of ultrafine PM characteristics, providing a robust route to monitoring, and potentially mitigating this hazard.},

For this reason, the authors focus on the development of a complete 3D model of Magnetic Brake System test-rig (built in COMSOL), including all the electromagnetic, circuital and mechanical parts. These parts are often studied separately in the literature; however, a combined analysis is crucial to correctly describe the behaviour of the whole system. The proposed model is highly modular (to describe different Magnetic Brake System test-rig layouts characterized by a different number of magnetic polar expansions) and aims at obtaining a compromise between accuracy and numerical efficiency. Subsequently, a second simplified lumped parameter model derived from the complete one and built in MATLAB is developed, to further reduce the computational load without decreasing the results accuracy. In this work, both the models have been developed and validated in collaboration Ferrovie dello Stato and compared with other simplified models present in the literature.},

In recent years, interest has grown in some railways towards the possible use of MTB against slippery tracks. However, there seems to be a lack of knowledge on the major benefits and possible side effects of using MTB to overcome low-adhesion conditions. This hinders the realization of a cost-benefit analysis to look at possible implementation. In order to contribute to a better understanding, field tests have been performed with the permanent MTB of an electrical multiple unit in a stabling yard. Low-adhesion conditions have been created by three types of contamination representative of slippery tracks, i.e. leaves, water, and grease. The entire work has been divided in two parts. In this Part I, emphasis is put on the adhesion recovery, in particular the benefit for subsequent wheel (or train) passages. Baseline tests (i.e. no use of MTB) have also been performed with water and leaves. Additionally, an adhesion improver widely used in the Dutch and British railways has also been tested with leaves to allow for a comparison in effectiveness with MTB under similar operating conditions. In each test, the wheel–rail adhesion conditions along the initially contaminated track have been measured to evaluate the adhesion improvement under the different testing conditions. © 2011, SAGE Publications.

Based on the discrete kink-wave model, a simulation of centering arrest was conducted. The simulation results were compared with experimental data from the United States (US) military standards, demonstrating that the basic changing laws are almost the same. On the basis of centering arrest, a simulation of yaw arrest was carried out. The results show that in yaw state, the difference in the lengths of the arresting cables on either side of the hook is smaller in the early stage after the hook hangs on the rope, which leads to little influence on load fluctuation produced by the kink-wave. With the increase in arresting distance, the difference in the lengths of the arresting cables on either side becomes larger, resulting in a situation in which the cable tension on the departure side will gradually become greater than that on the opposite side. In this situation, yaw landing has a negative impact on the characteristics of arresting safety, and the excessive yaw angle causes the aircraft to rush out of the safe landing area.},

	abstract = {The arresting dynamics of the aircraft on the aircraft carrier involves both a transient wave propagation process in rope and a smooth decelerating of aircraft. This brings great challenge on simulating the whole process since the former one needs small time-step to guarantee the stability, while the later needs large time-step to reduce calculation time. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a full-scale multibody dynamics model of arresting gear system making use of variable time-step integration scheme. Especially, a kind of new cable element that is capable of describing the arbitrary large displacement and rotation in three-dimensional space is adopted to mesh the wire cables, and damping force is used to model the effect of hydraulic system. Then, the stress of the wire ropes during the landing process is studied. Results show that propagation, reflection, and superposition of the stress wave between the deck sheaves contribute mainly to the peak value of stress. And the maximum stress in the case of landing deviate from the centerline is a little bit smaller than the case of landing along centerline. The multibody approach and arresting gear system model proposed here also provide an efficient way to design and optimize the whole mechanism. © 2013 Wenhou Shen et al.},

The design is based on the parameters of the high-speed train and the working principles of airplane wings. The proposed device is a unidirectional opening model driven by hydraulics. The prototype uses hard-wired signals to transmit braking commands on eight levels. The important characteristics of the device include a synchronous action and a fault-oriented security design. Its functions include service braking, gradual braking, emergency braking and self-checking. Simulation results show that deceleration in the high-speed zone between 250 and 500 km/h can be improved by between 8 and 60\%. When the train runs at 500 km/h, the braking deceleration rate can be improved by 0.12 m/s2. The simulation results are found to agree with wind tunnel test results. The braking characteristics are also investigated using a test bed, which mimics the aerodynamic load exerted on the prototype when the train is running between 0 and 550 km/h. It is clearly demonstrated that the proposed principle of the aerodynamic braking system is feasible and its design scheme is reasonable. The aerodynamic braking device can survive a 50,000 N aerodynamic load, and the time taken to achieve the maximum braking capacity, which is the time taken to take the brake panel from its closed position of -5 to the maximum angle of 75 , is less than 3 s. The proposed prototype therefore offers an important step in the design of practical systems. © Authors 2012.},

This research focuses on the impact of magnetic field sources used in the ECB. In addition, the number of magnetic field sources is also observed. In order to achieve an ECB design that can be easily applied in any types of vehicles, including motorcycles and compact cars, a compact ECB design with an excellent braking torque is required. In this study, a compact design of the ECB is obtained by distributing the required braking torque from the disc brake into multiple electromagnets. Finite element method-based modeling has been performed to study ECB parameters, including the number of coil winding, the number of electromagnets, and the electric current.

The airborne particles are measured by different aerosol instruments.

During the braking of a vehicle, the braking system must dissipate the kinetic energy by transforming it into heat energy. A too high temperature can lead to an almost total loss of braking efficiency. An excessive rise in brake temperature can also cause surface cracks extending to the outside edge of the drum friction surface. Heat transfer and temperature gradient, not to forget the vehicle's travel environment (high speed, heavy load, and steeply sloping road conditions), must thus be the essential criteria for any brake system design. The aim of the present investigation is to analyze the thermal behavior of different brake drum designs during the single emergency braking of a heavy-duty vehicle on a steeply sloping road. The calculation of the temperature field is performed in transient mode using a three-dimensional finite element model assuming a constant coefficient of friction. In this study, the influence of geometrical brake drum configurations on the thermal behavior of brake drums with two different materials in grey cast iron FG200 and aluminum alloy 356.0 reinforced with silicon carbide (SiC) particles is analyzed under extreme vehicle braking conditions.

Aerodynamic braking technology can effectively improve the braking effect of trains at high speeds.

The results show that the opening of the plate significantly changes the aerodynamic performance of the train, thereby greatly increasing the aerodynamic forces of the train and their fluctuation degree. The effect of the opening of the plate increases the turbulence of the downstream flow field around the tail car. The affected area is mainly concentrated in the flow field around the location of the plate for the pressure field and the whole flow field behind the plate for the velocity field.

	abstract = {There is increasing interest in the potential of urban rail to reduce the impact of metropolitan transportation due to its high capacity, reliability and absence of local emissions. However, in a context characterised by increasing capacity demands and rising energy costs, and where other transport modes are considerably improving their environmental performance, urban rail must minimise its energy use without affecting its service quality. Urban rail energy consumption is defined by a wide range of interdependent factors; therefore, a system wide perspective is required, rather than focusing on energy savings at subsystem level. This paper contributes to the current literature by proposing an holistic approach to reduce the overall energy consumption of urban rail. Firstly, a general description of this transport mode is given, which includes an assessment of its typical energy breakdown. Secondly, a comprehensive appraisal of the main practices, strategies and technologies currently available to minimise its energy use is provided. These comprise: regenerative braking, energy-efficient driving, traction losses reduction, comfort functions optimisation, energy metering, smart power management and renewable energy micro-generation. Finally, a clear, logical methodology is described to optimally define and implement energy saving schemes in urban rail systems. This includes general guidelines for a qualitative assessment and comparison of measures alongside a discussion on the principal interdependences between them. As a hypothetical example of application, the paper concludes that the energy consumption in existing urban rail systems could be reduced by approximately 25-35\% through the implementation of energy-optimised timetables, energy-efficient driving strategies, improved control of comfort functions in vehicles and wayside energy storage devices. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, a three-dimensional thermo-mechanical coupling model of high-speed wheel-mounted brake discs containing bolted joints and contact relationships is established. The direct coupling method is used to analyze the temperature and stress of the brake discs during an emergency braking event with an initial speed of 300 km/h. A full-scale bench test is also conducted to monitor the temperatures of the friction ring and bolted joints. The simulation result shows that the surface temperature of the friction ring reaches its peak value of 414 °C after 102 s of braking, which agrees well with the bench test result. The maximum alternating thermal stress occurs in the bolt hole where the maximum circumferential compressive stress is − 658 MPa and the maximum circumferential tensile stress is 134 MPa. During the braking process, the out-of-plane deformation of the middle part of the friction ring is larger than that of the edge, which increases the axial tensile load of the connecting bolt.

It is based on a numerical homogenization technique which allows to take into account a heterogeneous material and the generation of wear under contact conditions. Globally and locally, a finite element method is used. More precisely, at the micro scale, a behavior is computed from the microstructure and then injected into the macro model through contact stiffnesses. The approach being completely integrated between the macro and micro scales, a relocalization of the contact forces on the microstructure allows wear generation at the scale of the heterogeneities. An example is given in this paper where with respect to a reference case, the proposed method proves to be faster and as consistent. Graphic Abstract : [Figure not available: see fulltext.]},

The working life of a rigid clutch is the limiting factor when it comes to extracting maximum performance from a dual mass flywheel system, which is used in a lot of modern vehicles nowadays to lower fuel consumption and improve ride quality. In this study, we investigate the influence of different groove patterns on wear in rigid clutch facings and estimate their life using a comprehensive finite element model. The wear is calculated and analysed for five different groove patterns across two different inorganic materials, namely FTL180 and TF1600-MC2, using Archard’s Adhesive Wear Model. Coupled multi-physics elements are employed in the analysis to capture the effect of frictional heat generation on wear. We found that the Waffle pattern offered a decrease of 10.4\% in volumetric wear loss, a 5.78\% decrease in maximum wear thickness and an increase of 11.51\% in the average working life is used in city like conditions with frequent engagements. This work sheds light on the impact of groove patterns on clutch facing wear and opens a new path for the design and development of more resilient rigid clutches},

	abstract = {The brake pad is the key component in the braking system of high-speed railway trains. The running speeds of commercial high-speed railway trains in China can reach higher than 350 km·h−1. The friction coefficient of brake pads is a key factor determining the safety of any vehicle brake, and a high and stable friction coefficient is ideal for ensuring the safety of the braking system. In practical applications, the friction coefficient can vary because of the changes in the working conditions, such as sliding speed, braking pressure, and temperature between contact surfaces. Under severe conditions, such as high-speed braking and overload, the friction coefficient decreases markedly, which lengthens the braking distance and braking time. Based on the friction performance collaborative regulation theory of powder metallurgy friction materials, a Cu-based friction material was designed. The performance of the brake pad was tested on the full-scale dynamometer, and the characteristics of the friction film were analyzed in detail. Results show that the brake pad exhibits high stability of the friction coefficient, low wear loss, and the capability to protect the brake disc. Both the instantaneous friction coefficient and average friction coefficient of the developed brake pad meet the requirements of the TJ/CL307—2019 technical condition. The stability of the friction coefficient is 0.0015. The recession of the friction coefficient from 250 to 380 km·h−1 is as low as 0.027. The average friction coefficient at 380 km·h−1 remains at the relatively high value of 0.35, and the average wear loss is only 0.06 cm3·MJ−1. The excellent friction and braking performance of brake pads can be attributed to the formation of friction films with high strength and toughness and low transfer rate. The friction components with large particle sizes are used as external motion obstacles to nail the friction film. The submicron wear debris in the friction film serves as the meshing point between the friction film and the dual disc to provide friction resistance, thus maintaining the friction coefficient during high-speed braking. Oxides are continuously supplied by adding easily oxidized components, and the nanosized oxides generated by the severe grinding process are used in the dispersion-strengthening phase. The multiscale particles synergistically enhance the dynamic stability of the friction film. The metal oxide layer on the friction surface reduces and stabilizes the friction coefficient and enhances the wear resistance because it prevents metal–metal contact between the brake pad and the brake disc. The fade phenomenon that occurs under high braking speed and overload conditions is effectively prevented.},

Based on many years of research using a brake bench to test railway disc brakes, the authors developed multiple regression models for the average friction coefficient and fluctuations (tolerances) in the instantaneous friction coefficient and achieved 870 results. The models proposed three types of variables: the input braking parameters (speed, pressure, and mass to be braked), operational parameters (the wear on the friction linings and the brake disc), and design parameters (perforations in the form of holes on the disc surface). The above two models were validated on the basis of 384 brakes, and in subsequent stages a further evaluation was performed.

In this study, a newly developed copper metal matrix composite (Cu-MMC) for the aforementioned brake pads was fabricated by powder metallurgy route. The microstructure and mechanical properties of Cu-MMC were investigated. Cu-MMC was tribo-evaluated by a full-scale dynamometer, and special attention was paid on the braking performances during emergency stop-braking at initial speeds from 300 to 380 km/h. Examination and analysis of the worn surface and subsurface corroborated the wear mechanism. The results indicate that Cu-MMC exhibits excellent properties and can meet the technical requirements, so it holds great promise for applications in high-speed trains.},

But its operating environments are complex and changeable, leading to insufficient research on friction performance of copper (Cu)-based powder metallurgy (PM) brake pads and difficult prediction of the wear rate. Therefore, we explore the variation trend of the friction performance of the brake pad with different multi-factors coupling braking conditions, and predict the wear rate of Cu-based PM brake pad based on Atom Search Optimization-Back Propagation (ASO-BP) neural network. The Cu-based PM brake pad regarded as the research object whose friction coefficient, friction temperature, braking distance, wear rate, and change mechanism are discussed with multi-factors coupling braking conditions, and wear rate is predicted based on ASO-BP neural network that can obtained by optimizing the weights and thresholds of the Back Propagation (BP) neural network with Atom Search Optimization (ASO) method. The results show that braking speed and braking pressure are main contributors to braking ability, the average coefficient of friction of the Cu-based PM brake pads varied nearly between 0.35 and 0.45 with different braking conditions, the maximum of temperature, braking distance, braking time and the wear rate of the brake pad are 473 °C, 3506 m, 138s and 0.14 cm3/MJ, respectively. And the prediction accuracy of brake pad wear rate based on ASO-BP neural network can reach 97.3\%.},

	abstract = {A tribology test was carried out on a test device to simulate the braking performance of a high-speed train and investigate the effect of the friction block's residual height on friction-induced vibration and noise (FIVN) characteristics and interface tribology behavior. A finite element model (FEM) of the test device was established using the real boundary conditions and component material parameters. A wear simulation of the friction block was performed, and the Archard wear equation was used to obtain the surface wear of the friction block after stable friction had occurred. Complex eigenvalue analysis (CEA) and implicit dynamic analysis (IDA) were carried out. The effect of the friction block's height on the surface wear level, the complex mode and dynamic response, and the interface contact behavior are discussed. The results show that the friction block wears at an angle due to the friction force at the braking interface. Thus, the contact stress occurs predominantly at the leading edge of the friction block, leading to significant wear, high temperatures, and eccentric wear of the friction block. The taller the friction block, the larger the inclination angle is, and the more significant the eccentric wear degree is. Excessive wear at the leading edge causes debris to enter the brake interface. As a result, the wear surface of friction block is significantly damaged, including large contact plateaus and extensive exfoliation and ploughing. This damage increases the complexity of the braking interface's tribological behavior and causes high-intensity FIVN. However, the inclination angle decreases as the friction block's height decreases, resulting in better wear behavior of the friction interface and lower FIVN intensity. Although the friction block height significantly affects the intensity and evolution of FIVN, it does not change the system's inherent frequency.},

Considering elastoplastic contact mechanics of the friction surfaces, combined with Archard wear calculation theory, a wear calculation model of fractal rough surface is established, and a wear life prediction of the brake disc is proposed. Based on high-speed and heavy-load braking conditions, the influence of different braking parameters on the surface wear of brake disc is studied. Moreover, a pin-on-disc wear test is used to verify the validity of the wear calculation model, and the average relative error of test and simulation is 4.97\%. The research results show that the fractal parameters affect the complexity of the rough surface, and surface wear is mainly caused by interface plastic contact. The friction coefficient is large, which can strengthen the surface shear effect. Large load and high speed would increase the real contact area of the surface and increase the wear volume per unit time. Furthermore, the wear life of the brake disc could be estimated, which is of great significance for raising the wear life of the brake disc, improving braking life and braking efficiency.},

To meet the versatile requirements posed by brake system manufacturers and railway operators, formulation of contemporary organic composite friction materials are fairly complex containing in some cases even more than a dozen different ingredients. To conduct the design process of new materials effectively, it is necessary to understand the influence of individual raw materials on properties of the composite. In this study two organic composite friction materials were compared extensively allowing for investigation of influence of two ingredients, namely quartz and petroleum coke, on the properties of the composite. Discussion of results includes analysis of instantaneous and mean dynamic coefficient of friction in relation to initial velocity, contact force and temperature. Both full- and reduced-scale dynamometer test results are discussed. In addition, the mechanical properties of the materials are presented and compared. All tested characteristics were influenced by the formulation modification. The effect was pronounced enough to allow drawing conclusions on qualitative relation between formulation and properties of the composite friction material.},

Empirical models are widely used, and advanced versions have been used for train dynamics simulations. Fluid dynamics models are better models to study brake system behaviour but are more complex and slower in computation. Fluid-empirical dynamics models combine fluid dynamics brake pipe models and empirical brake valve models. They are a balance of model fidelity and computational speeds.

	abstract = {In order to study the effect of interface modifications combination of multiple friction blocks on truck brake squeal, a field test was carried out in this study. In the test, the vibration acceleration and the noise signals of the truck braking system were collected. The test results showed that the high-frequency squeal noise during braking resulted from the frictional vibration of the braking system. A simplified finite element model of the heavy truck braking system was established to investigate the effect of slotting and chamfering of friction block on brake squeal. The results of complex eigenvalue analysis indicate that the interface modifications have a great influence on truck brake squeal. A proper combination of slotting and chamfering of friction blocks is useful for the reduction of brake squeal tendency. This study can provide guidance for the design and optimization of silent braking system.},

	abstract = {In this paper, the transient and contact analysis of functionally graded (FG) brake disk is presented. The analysis was carried out using ANSYS parametric design language (APDL). The FG brake disk is made of metal-ceramic material. The material properties vary in radial direction with the values from full-metal at the inner radius to that of full-ceramic at the outer radius. In the analysis, FG brake disk is in contact with one pure pad disk and coulomb contact friction is considered as heat source. The non-dimensional results are obtained for specific value of grading index (n=1) by considering different material property divisions of 25, 50, 100 and 200. The results presented are for the pressure distribution, total stress, pad penetration, friction stress, heat flux and temperature during contact, for different values of contact stiffness factor, Fkn, which depends on the property gradation of FG brake disk with 200 material property divisions. The results show that the contact pressure and contact total stress increase with increasing values of Fkn, and hence it can be concluded that gradation of the metal-ceramic has significant effect in the thermomechanical response of FG brake disks. © 2010.},

For this purpose, a one-dimensional boundary-value heat conduction problem was formulated for the coating (TBC) - substrate (disc) system. It was assumed that the materials of both the coating and the substrate are thermally sensitive and characterized by essential thermal nonlinearity. The surface of the coating was heated by a heat flux with intensity proportional to the friction power during single braking. Thermal contact between the coating and substrate is perfect. The solution to the problem was obtained by means of an integro-interpolation variant of the method of lines and the DIFSUB package for numerical solving of systems of ordinary differential equations. Quasi-static thermal stresses in the strip with taking into account change in temperature mechanical properties, were determined, too.

For the linear case, computing the solution to the given problem is a straightforward process, the displacements are obtained in a single step and all the other quantities are evaluated afterwards. When faced with a nonlinear problems, in this case with a contact nonlinearity, one needs to account for the fact that the stiffness matrix of the systems varies with the loading, the force vs. stiffness relation being unknown prior to the beginning of the analysis. Modern software using the finite element method to solve contact problems usually approaches such problems via two basic theories that, although different in their approaches, lead to the desired solutions. One of the theories is known as the penalty function method, and the other as the Lagrange multipliers method. The hereby paper briefly presents the two methods emphasizing the penalty based ones. The paper also underscores the influence of input parameters for the case of the two methods on the results when using the software ANSYS 12.},

In a rolling and sliding contact, the two interacting surfaces characteristically move at different speeds in a tangential direction. The Tribology Group at KTH Machine Design has worked on simulating friction and wear in rolling and sliding contacts for more than 20 years. The modelling principles the group has successfully used are based on (i) the single-point observation method and (ii) treating friction and wear as initial-value processes.

Very good correlation of FE results with dynamometer and vehicle service data was achieved.

The comparison with the existing disc showed the advantages and limitations of both designs. The recommendations for a successful wheel-hub-mounted disc design are also given.

	abstract = {The prediction of the behaviour of wheel-mounted disc brakes is particularly complex due to non-symmetrical heat input, making disc coning during braking inevitable. Furthermore, severe brake applications cause high local temperatures and stresses, resulting in disc material yielding and permanent disc coning. To ensure adequate brake operation, disc coning during braking and permanent disc coning must be kept within acceptable limits. Obviously, excessive hub stresses must also be avoided, to ensure structural integrity throughout expected brake life. In order to predict disc permanent coning, it is necessary to model macro thermal effects, i.e. thermoelastic instability. The paper deals with different finite element (FE) modelling techniques and measurements of disc material properties, establishing efficient methodology for the prediction of wheel-mounted disc performance. The procedure developed is widely based on a standard FE code, with subroutines developed for data preparation, processing and visualization. This approach, combined with the efficiency and robustness of the methodology, is very suitable for industrial use, reducing risks, costs and development time. © IMechE 2004.},

The naphthalene sublimation technique of heat/mass transfer analogy method is used. The significant result is that the diameter ratio of the brake disc to the wheel determines the convective heat transfer characteristics on the vehicle's brake disc outside surface. Due to the influence of the ground, the average Nusselt number on the surface of a break disc is larger than that of a rotating disc in crossflow at the same Reynolds number. The local Nusselt number on the surface of a break disc decreases along the radius direction. The correlations of the local and average Nusselt numbers, Reynolds number, and the diameter ratio of brake disc to wheel are established.

	title = {The dissipation of frictional energy from the interface of an annular disc brake},
	abstract = {The performance of resin bonded composite friction materials in a particular brake design is strongly dependent upon the dissipation of frictional heat from the interface. This energy transformation has been studied using finite element techniques for a simulation of the braking friction process in an annular disc brake, which combines both brake performance and brake temperature analysis and avoids many of the assumptions necessary in conventional analyses. Negligible amounts of energy interchange, compared with the total kinetic energy dissipated, arise from chemical reactions within the friction material, but the formation of surface layers and interfacial wear products do have a signijicant effect upon heat transfer from the interface. Calculated temperature distributions over indioidual brake applications indicate that interface contact resistance leads to different temperatures at the surfaces of disc and lining so that heat partition between the two mating bodies cannot realistically be assumed constant under braking conditions. The distribution of frictional heat generation over the interface is dependent upon interface pressure distribution and is therefore also affected by material wear and thermal expansion. These effects are incorporated in the analysis, and calculated temperature, interface contact and pressure, and wear distributions are compared with observed and measured experimental results from an annular brake rig.

	abstract = {The transient thermal response of a newly developed ventilated brake disc cored with a porous medium (wire-woven bulk diamond) is compared with those of a solid brake disc and a conventionally ventilated brake disc with pin fins. The best-performing brake disc vis-à-vis the operating temperature is dependent on the duration of braking: for a short braking event, T(solid) {\textless} T(pin-finned) {\textless} T(porous); however, for extended braking T(porous) {\textless} T(pin-finned) {\textless} T(solid). These experimental results are explained in terms of the governing thermophysical parameters using a classical first-order unsteady-state differential equation. The initial rate of increase in the brake disc temperature is dominated by the thermal capacity term; hence, for a short braking event, solid discs with a large thermal capacity operate at a low temperature. However, for extended braking, ventilated discs run cooler and reach lower steady-state temperatures than solid rotors do owing to the increased convective surface area and the forced convection in the ventilated channels. With the wire-woven bulk diamond core which allows a slightly lighter disc than the conventional pin-finned disc, a substantially lower steady-state temperature can be achieved, resulting from promoted flow mixing by three-dimensional wire-woven bulk diamond ligaments which enhance convection.},

All three modes of heat transfer (conduction, convec-tion and radiation) have been analysed along with the design features of the brake assembly and their interfaces. The spin rig proved to be very valuable equipment; experiments enabled the determination of the thermal contact resistance between the disc and wheel carrier. The analyses demonstrated the sensitivity of this mode of heat transfer to clamping pressure. For convective cooling, heat transfer coecients were measured and very similar results were obtained from spin rig experiments and CFD analyses. The nature of radiative heat dissipation implies substantial eects at high temperatures. The results indicate substantial change of emissivity throughout the brake application. The innuence of brake cooling parameters on the disc temperature has been investigated by FE modelling of a long drag brake application. The thermal power dissipated during the drag brake application has been analysed to reveal the contribution of each mode of heat transfer.},

The material properties of disk are assumed to be represented by power-law distributions in the radial direction. The inner and outer surfaces considered are metal and ceramic, respectively. Pure material is considered for the brake pad. Coulomb contact friction is assumed as the heat source. It is divided into two equal parts between pad and brake disk which leads to thermal stresses. Mechanical response of FG disks are compared and verified with the known results from the literatures. The results show that the maximum value of radial displacement in mounted FG brake disk is not at outer surface. It is found that the all areas between pad and brake disk is in full-contact status when the ratio of pad thickness to brake disk thickness is 0.66. It is observed that the total strain due to thermomechanical load is negative for some parts of the disks, whereas, the thermal strains are always positive.

The homogeneous multi-layered model is used to approximate the arbitrarily varying material properties of the FGM coating which is divided into several sub-layers whose material properties is assumed to be constant. It is assumed that a rigid insulated punch is sliding over the surface of an FGM coated half-plane with a constant velocity, which generates frictional heating at the contact interface with its value proportional to the contact pressure, frictional coefficient and sliding velocity. The transfer matrix method and the Fourier integral transform technique are employed to convert the problem into Cauchy singular integral equations which are then numerically solved to obtain the contact stress, in-plane stress and surface temperature. The effects of the gradient index, Peclet number and friction coefficient on the thermoelastic contact characteristics are discussed in detail. Different gradient types of FGMs are considered in numerical examples to compare and identify effective gradient type in suppressing the maximum tensile stress and lowering the maximum surface temperature.

With a copper-base sintered brake pad and a forge steel disc, up-to-brake experiments have been conducted on a full-scale test bench at a highest speed of 200 Km/h and a maximum braking force of 22.5 KN. The temperature distributions on brake disc surface have been acquired by an infrared thermal camera, and the contact pressure on the contact surface of the friction pair has been calculated by the finite element software ABAQUS. The results show that the area and thermal gradient of the hot bands increase with the increase of braking speed and braking force. The hot bands occur in priority at the radial location of r=200 mm and r=300 mm, and move radially in the braking process. The finite element modelling calculation indicates that the distribution of the contact pressure on the disc surface in radial direction is in a "U"-shape. The maximum contact pressure occur at the radial locations of r=200 mm and r=300 mm, and the minimum contact pressure occur in the vicinity of the mean radius of the disc. The conformity of contact pressure distributions with the practical temperature evolutions indicates that the non-uniform distribution of the contact pressure is the factor resulting in the appearance of hot bands on the disc surface. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications.},

In the present paper, two approaches are adopted to analyse the thermomechanical interaction in a pin-on-disc experimental study of railway braking materials. In a first part, the thermal problem is studied to find the heat partitioning between pin and disc motivated by the fact that wear mechanisms can be explained with a better understanding of the prevailing thermal conditions. The numerical model is calibrated using the experimental results. In a second part, the frictionally induced thermoelastic instabilities at the pin-disc contact are studied using a numerical method and comparing them with the phenomena observed in the experiments. The effects of temperature on material properties and on material wear are considered. It is found from the thermal analysis that the pin temperature and the heat flux to the pin increase with increasing disc temperatures up to a transition stage. This agrees with the behaviour found in the experiments. Furthermore, the thermoelastic analysis displays calculated pressure and the temperature distributions at the contact interface that are in agreement with the hot spot behaviour observed in the experiments. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

These regions then take very high temperature and passage of hot spots moving under the brake pads can cause undesirable effects, such as brake fade, thermal cracks, and vibration.

Model of materials with a simple nonlinearity has been adopted, i.e. materials in which coefficients of heat conduction and specific heat depend on the temperature, and their ratio - coefficient of thermal diffusivity - is constant. Linearization of the corresponding boundary-value heat conduction problem by the Kirchhoff transformation and linearizing parameter method has been performed. The numerical-analytical solution to the problem has been found by using the integral Laplace transform and the Newton-Raphson methods. The influence of the thermosensitive materials of titanium pad, sliding over the surface of the disk made of steel, aluminum alloy or gray cast iron, on the temperature has been studied. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {During the braking phase, the heat produced by friction between pads and disc cannot be entirely dissipated. Consequently, the brake disc, especially if very hard braking occur, can accumulate large amounts of heat in a short time so producing high gradients of temperature on it. Under these conditions, functionality and safety of the brake system can be compromised. The object of this study is to investigate, under extreme working conditions, the thermomechanical behaviour of different brake rotors in order to evaluate their efficiency and stability and to identify any compromising weakness on them. In particular, by means of FEM thermo-mechanical coupled analyses, one full disc and three ventilated rotors with different shapes have been studied. A very hard (fading) test has been used to evaluate the performances of the discs in terms of temperature distribution, stresses and strains. Obtained results demonstrate that the analysed ventilated discs, unlike the full rotor, can be effectively used in very hard working conditions, always ensuring high safety levels. Among the studied rotors, the curved-vanes disc was found to be the best solution.},

	abstract = {Brake judder is one of the most serious problems in automotive-brake systems. It is basically a forced vibration caused by the friction-surface geometry of a brake disc, and therefore, disc rotors play a significant role in judder. There are two types of judder: cold and hot. Hot judder is caused by the thermo-mechanical deformation of a brake disc due to high-speed braking. There are several shapes of deformation, e.g., coning and circumferential waviness. Circumferential waviness is caused by thermo-mechanical buckling and typically found as a butterfly shape in a 2nd rotational-order and hot-spotting. In a previous paper, two groups of disc castings with different material homogeneity were machined intentionally to have two kinds of dimensional variations. From repetitive high-speed braking tests of these discs, both the material and dimensional homogeneity were found to affect the wave-like deformation of discs in the 1st and 2nd rotational-orders with different significance between the two casting groups. There are many mechanisms affecting disc geometry during braking. Plastic deformation and wear cause permanent effects, while thermal expansion and elastic deformation are reversible. A disc's initial shape before braking affects its geometry both transiently and permanently. Considering these effects, the previous test results were reanalyzed in the present paper. Some discs exhibited large transient runout and DTV but small permanent DTV, while others behaved differently. The thermal deformation and differential wear were confirmed to interactively affect the transient and permanent geometry of operating brake discs.},

	abstract = {During friction it is well known that the real contact area is much lower to the theoretical one and that it evolves constantly during braking. It influences drastically the system’s performance. Conversely the system behavior modifies the loading conditions and consequently the contact surface area. This interaction between scales is well-known for the problematic of vibrations induced by friction but also for the thermomechanical behavior. Indeed, it is necessary to develop models combining a fine description of the contact interface and a model of the whole brake system. This is the aim of the present work. A multiscale strategy is propose to integrate the microscopic behavior of the interface in a macroscopic numerical model. Semi-analytical resolution is done on patches at the contact scale while FEM solution with contact parameters embedded the solution at the microscale is used. Asperities and plateaus are considered at the contact interface. FFT techniques are used to accelerate the resolution at the micro-scale. As an example the multiscale model is applied into a complex value analysis used to identify modal coupling in NVH simulations. With this model the interaction between non uniform surface and system dynamic behavior is clearly shown. The contact surface variations clearly affect the modal coupling and therefore noise propensity.},

Thermal and stress fields were obtained under various conditions in the disc fixing holes and on the contact faces of the two half discs. From the numerical results, it was found that the effect of the boundary conditions on the magnitude of thermal stress was about 10\%. Numerical temperature data in the radial direction could be curve-fitted to functions with the same order as the heat flux profiles. The coefficients of correlation of the curve-fittings were more than 0.91.

This heat was partitioned into two contacting bodies (disc rotor and pad). Both analytical and numerical approaches were used to carry out the analysis. Analytically, the transient temperature obtained by the partial solution approach and the stress field were evaluated by the elastic von Mises criterion. In the numerical approach, temperature and stress response were analyzed by the explicit standard ABAQUS. From both results, high thermal gradient and von Mises stress distribution were observed at the sharp edges of the disc, which causes a decrement in braking efficiency and an overall drop in braking performance.},

	abstract = {Key objectives in off-highway vehicular powertrain development are fuel efficiency and environmental protection. As a result, palliative measures are made to reduce parasitic frictional losses while sustaining machine operational performance and reliability. A potential key contributor to the overall power loss is the rotation of disengaged wet multi-plate pack brake friction. Despite the numerous advantages of wet brake pack design, during high-speed manoeuvre in highway travel or at start-up conditions, significant frictional power losses occur. The addition of recessed grooves on the brake friction lining is used to dissipate heat during engagement. These complicate the prediction of performance of the system, particularly when disengaged. To characterise the losses produced by these components, a combined numerical and experimental approach is required. This paper presents a Reynolds-based numerical model including the effect of fluid inertia and squeeze film transience for prediction of performance of wet brake systems. Model predictions are compared with very detailed combined Navier–Stokes and Rayleigh-Plesset fluid dynamics analysis to ascertain its degree of conformity to representative physical operating conditions, as well the use of a developed experimental rig. The combined numerical and experimental approach is used to predict significant losses produced during various operating conditions. It is shown that cavitation becomes significant at low temperatures due to micro-hydrodynamic action, enhanced by high fluid viscosity. The magnitude of the losses for these components under various operating conditions is presented. The combined numerical-experimental study of wet multi-plate brakes of off-highway vehicles with cavitation flow dynamics has not hitherto been reported in the literature.},

	abstract = {Frictional work in sliding contacts plays an important role in tribology and other related areas. Applications may be found in many engineering fields. Braking of vehicles is almost exclusively done by friction brakes, and thus, understanding of the mechanisms involved is an area of great concern when designing a brake system. From a theoretical as well as experimental viewpoint, little is actually known about the location, magnitude and distribution of pressure and temperature between sliding bodies. This is especially true when considering high energy sliding contacts, such as in brakes and clutches. The present paper concerns the calculation of temperature and pressure distribution between two sliding bodies. More specifically, an instability phenomenon known as TEI (ThermoElastic Instability), which is frequently observed in experiments is investigated. TEI occurs on both the friction material and the opposing sliding material. This is a major cause for excessive temperatures and consequently wear. TEI on the friction material appears as slowly moving contact points. The cause for this is an interaction between wear and thermal expansion. In this paper, the sliding material is modeled as a smooth rigid surface but thermally conductive. To calculate the interface pressure and temperature, a continuum thermomechanical wear model is used. The model can handle temperature dependent variables, such as the friction and wear. The thermomechanical wear model is discretized by finite elements, and to solve the resulting system of equations a Newton type method is used. The model shows promising results and both temperature and pressure distributions are believed to be properly determined. It is also shown, that the motion of the contact points on the friction material is indeed an interaction between wear and thermal expansion. The model can provide qualitative recommendations regarding friction material properties. Copyright © 2000 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.},

	abstract = {Many parts of motor vehicles contribute actively or passively to increasing operation performance. The safety is closely related to the effectiveness of the braking system. Due to the fact that the automotive industry is a branch of economics that uses products obtained in almost all other industries, the current concerns are directed towards the application of the latest research in the field of modern materials and technologies in all fields involved in the manufacture of motor vehicles. The proposed and carried of this paper aimed to presented, obtained, characterize and test some organic composite materials, designed to make brake pads for the braking systems of small cars with medium performances. The experimental research strategy included the determination of the functional characteristics of organic composite materials developed. In this respect, experimental laboratory determinations were carried out on the friction and wear of composite materials produced, using standardized test methods. The knowledge of these elements provides the possibility of pertinent assessments on the durability in operation of the composite material used for the manufacture of brake pads.},

This residual stress is often ignored during finite element analysis of railway wheels. This is likely due to the complexity of the analysis needed to predict the residual stress field. A number of non-linear finite element simulations were performed, each one testing a different assumption or simplification. Based on the simulation results, if quantitative residual stress results are required, the important factors to take into account are material creep, the strain hardening model and parameters, latent heat of phase transformation, phase transformation strain, surface temperature dependent boiling heat transfer coefficients, and radiation.},

The main focus of the study is the effect of material anisotropy on thermomechanical instability (TMI) of friction linings used in automotive disc clutches or brakes. The model is validated by comparing the result to an existing eigenvalue solution. A parametric study on the material anisotropy revealed that for contact with the separation effect, an increase in elastic modulus E11 in the sliding direction and thermal conductivity K22 in the thickness direction discourage TMI formation. Conversely, a higher thermal conductivity K11 in the sliding direction and elastic modulus E22 in the thickness direction make the friction material more susceptible to TMI formation for a full-contact regime and contact with the separation effect. In addition, the effect of the thermal expansion coefficient was considered in this work.},

	abstract = {The transient thermal response of a newly developed ventilated brake disc cored with a porous medium (wire-woven bulk diamond) is compared with those of a solid brake disc and a conventionally ventilated brake disc with pin fins. The best-performing brake disc vis-à-vis the operating temperature is dependent on the duration of braking: for a short braking event, T(solid) {\textless} T(pin-finned) {\textless} T(porous); however, for extended braking T(porous) {\textless} T(pin-finned) {\textless} T(solid). These experimental results are explained in terms of the governing thermophysical parameters using a classical first-order unsteady-state differential equation. The initial rate of increase in the brake disc temperature is dominated by the thermal capacity term; hence, for a short braking event, solid discs with a large thermal capacity operate at a low temperature. However, for extended braking, ventilated discs run cooler and reach lower steady-state temperatures than solid rotors do owing to the increased convective surface area and the forced convection in the ventilated channels. With the wire-woven bulk diamond core which allows a slightly lighter disc than the conventional pin-finned disc, a substantially lower steady-state temperature can be achieved, resulting from promoted flow mixing by three-dimensional wire-woven bulk diamond ligaments which enhance convection.},

But as historian Laurent Dubois makes clear, its difficulties are rooted in its founding revolution, the only successful slave revolt in the history of the world; the hostility that this rebellion generated among the colonial powers; and the intense struggle within Haiti itself to define its newfound freedom and realize its promise. Dubois vividly depicts the isolation and impoverishment that followed the 1804 uprising. He details how the indemnity imposed by the former French rulers initiated a devastating cycle of debt, while frequent interventions by the United States further undermined Haiti's independence. At the same time, Dubois shows, the internal debates about what Haiti should do with its hard-won liberty alienated the nation's leaders from the broader population, setting the stage for enduring political conflict. Yet the Haitian people have never given up on their struggle for true democracy.--From publisher description.},

The calculation results show that for the point on the tread, the calculated temperature and the change characteristics based on the two heat source loading methods are quite different. However with the increase of the distance below the tread, the calculated temperature difference based on the two heat source loading methods decreases rapidly, and for the point 2 mm below the tread, the difference can be approximately ignored.

	abstract = {Disc brakes are exposed to large thermal stresses during routine braking and extraordinary thermal stresses during hard braking. High-g decelerations typical of passenger vehicles are known to generate temperatures as high as 900°C in a fraction of a second. These large temperature excursions have two possible outcomes: thermal shock that generates surface cracks; and/or large amounts of plastic deformation in the brake rotor. In the absence of thermal shock, a relatively small number of high-g braking cycles are found to generate macroscopic cracks running through the rotor thickness and along the radius of the disc brake. The analysis herein shows that rotor failure is a consequence of low cycle thermo-mechanical fatigue. An analysis of the vehicle dynamics was used to find a heat flux equation related to braking forces. The heat flux equation was then used in a finite element analysis to determine the temperature profile in the brake. Once the brake temperature was obtained, a simplified shrink fit analysis was used to estimate the stresses that arise during hard braking. This approach shows that plastic deformation occurs due to the large thermal strains associated with high-g braking. The calculated strain amplitude was then used in a Coffin-Manson law to predict the number of high-g braking cycles to failure. Good agreement was obtained between reported braking cycles to failure and the proposed theoretical approach © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The generated frictional heat, during braking operation causes several negative effects on the brake system such as brake fade, premature wear, thermal cracks and disc thickness variation. It is then important to determine the temperature field of the brake disc. In the present work, thermal analysis of the wheel-mounted brake disc R920K for the ER24PC locomotive is investigated. The brake disc and fluid zone are simulated as a 3D model with a thermal coupling boundary condition. The braking process is simulated in laboratory and the experimental data are used to verify the simulation results. During the braking, the maximum temperature was observed in the middle of braking process instead of the braking end point. Moreover, a large lagging was observed for fins temperature which renders no cooling at the beginning of the braking. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The perforated block is able to trap a large portion of wear debris and form smoother contact plateaus on the worn surface compared to the block without perforation. This characteristic is beneficial to improve the wear status of the friction interface. Additionally, the perforated block displays a uniform thermal distribution on the friction interface, and exhibits lower brake noise during testing.

The modified microstructure consisting of a white etching layer (WEL) containing nanosized ferrite was observed on the friction surface of worn brake discs. In order to analyze how sequential thermal and mechanical stress affected crack propagation and microstructure evolution in brake discs, successive braking cycles were simulated on a full-scale braking bench test rig. Crack initiation and propagation mechanisms were proposed based on the experimental results, i.e., (i) occurrence of heat checking caused by heating and cooling transients during braking; (ii) heat checking increasing the roughness of the friction surface which in turn caused a local stress concentration and (iii) localized friction stress and thermal stress driving the heat checking to propagate and coalesce with the radial main crack. Analysis of the thermal-mechanical conditions that exist at the friction surface during braking indicates that WEL formation can be attributed to severe plastic deformation caused by the repeated friction between the disc and pads. Mechanical testing also indicated that WEL formation is not detrimental to brake disc integrity.},

	abstract = {Cosmetic products are generally formulated as emulsions, ointments, solutions or powders containing active ingredients. According to EU legislation, a cosmetic product is "any substance or preparation intended to be placed in contact with the various external parts of the human body with a view exclusively or mainly to cleaning, perfuming them, changing their appearance, and/or correcting body odors and/or protecting them or keeping them in good conditions". However, science advancement in both active carriers and ingredients has streamlined the process through which many cosmetic products by their delivery systems can induce modifications on the skin physiology. This is the reason why Reed and Kligman redefined these products as "cosmeceuticals", which refers to the combination of cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. Until recently, the term of cosmeceuticals has not had legal significance. The so-called cosmeceuticals, in fact, may induce modifications on the skin physiology, modifying, for example, transepidermal water loss, keratinocytes cohesion and turnover, modulating the inflammatory cascade, and/or altering the surface microbiota by the activity of the preservatives content. For these reasons, they are claimed to have medical or drug-like benefits. Naturally, their effectiveness on minor skin disorders or mild skin abnormalities has to be shown by in vitro and in vivo studies. On the other hand, their formulations contain emulsifiers, preservatives, and other chemicals which, by their cumulative use, may provoke side effects, such as allergic and/or sensitization phenomena. Moreover, many ingredients and packaging for such products are not biodegradable. In this study, we would like to introduce an innovative category of cosmeceuticals made by biodegradable nonwoven tissues. These cosmeceutical tissues, produced through the use of natural fibers, may bind different active ingredients and therefore become effective as antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, sun-protective, whitening, or anti-aging products, depending on the ingredient(s) used. Differently from the usual cosmetics, they do not contain preservatives, emulsifiers, colors, and other chemicals. They can be applied as dried tissue on wet skin, remaining in loco for around 30 min, slowly releasing the active ingredients entrapped into the fibers. It is interesting to underline that the tissue, acting as a carrier, has its own effectiveness via chitin and lignin polymers with an antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activity. When hydrolyzed by the human microbiota enzymes, they give rise to ingredients used as cell nourishment or energy. This paper will review part of the scientific research results, supporting this new category of biodegradable cosmetic products known as facial mask sheets.},

Appropriate modelling of heat input and boundary conditions in railway disc brake thermal load simulation plays a key role to predict exact results. Starting from early generation of railway technology, many researchers have dealt with FEM modelling, although lack of uniformity has been prevailing between them. Based on this problem, this review tries to answer the research question: “What FE boundary conditions and heat input modelling have been utilized in railway disc brake temperature, stress and fatigue simulations?”. Modelling effectiveness is evaluated based on boundary condition estimation, and spatial and time variation. The review is based on 49 significant publications available from 1995 to 2020. A method of systematic literature review is used to collect, identify and filter past and current trends in modelling. No study was revealed to incorporate all thermal modelling observed in actual braking conditions, including heat transfer modes, heat input calculations, heat applications, and its spatial and time variation.},

Heat energy generated must be dissipated into the surroundings in order to prevent brake overheating. Traditionally, a lot of experimental testing is performed to ensure correct brake operation under all possible load scenarios. However, with the development of simulation techniques, many vehicle manufacturers today are looking into partially or completely replacing physical experiments by virtual testing. Such a transition has several substantial benefits, but simultaneously a lot of challenges and limitations need to be addressed and understood for reliable and accurate simulation results. This paper summarizes many of such challenges, discusses the effects that can and cannot be captured, and gives a broader picture of the issues faced when conducting numerical brake cooling simulations.},

	abstract = {During tread braking, the treads of railway wheels are subjected to a complex loading due to combined rolling contact and thermally induced stresses. In revenue traffic the running mode of the train varies and the operational parameters will influence the life of the wheels. To prevent excessive damage, it is therefore important to understand at which operational conditions wheel damage becomes unacceptable. The current study aims to find limits for tread braking with respect to the influence of thermal stresses on rolling contact fatigue (RCF) of the wheel tread when subjected to repeated stop braking. A parametric study, using 3D FE simulations and involving operational parameters such as axle load, maximum vehicle speed, deceleration, brake block material and initial wheel temperature, is carried out for a new wheel with an S-shaped web. Additional analyses investigate impact from wheel geometry by studying a wheel with a straight web and a wheel with a thin (worn) rim. The effects of simultaneous thermal loading from wheel–block frictional contact during braking and mechanical loading, due to the traversing wheel–rail rolling contact, are studied in an uncoupled thermomechanical analysis. In the wheel–rail contact simulations, frictional rolling contact stress distributions induced by braking are accounted for. Interfacial shear stresses and partial slip are also included in the model. A temperature-dependent elastoplastic model is utilised to characterise changes in material behaviour during braking. In the vicinity of the wheel tread, damage evolutions for the studied brake load cases are evaluated. The results show that high tread temperatures, in particular temperatures above 450 °C, have a strong detrimental influence on the RCF formation and, hence, also on the thermomechanical capacity of the wheel. On the other hand, it is found that for braking temperatures between 300 °C and 375 °C, the fatigue resistance is increased due to strain hardening effects. In addition, the parametric study points towards actual braking load cases that can give such temperatures in terms of initial speeds, axle loads, etcetera. Specifically, the study shows that the train axle load, that controls the normal wheel–rail contact force, has a substantial impact on the life of the wheel treads. Wheels having straight webs and S-shaped wheel web exhibit the same fatigue life of their treads, whereas a reduction in wheel rim thickness promotes ratchetting due to increased flexural stresses from the mechanical wheel–rail contact loading.},

Thermal comfort requirements require careful envelope design coupled with the appropriate air-conditioning system operation strategies. One of the most prominent examples of such buildings is mosques. Mosques are usually occupied five intermittent times day and night all year round. Like any other building, they have to be mechanically air-conditioned to achieve the required thermal comfort for worshippers especially in harsh climatic regions. This paper describes the physical and operating characteristics typical for the intermittently occupied mosques as well as the results of the thermal optimization of a medium size mosque in the two hot-dry and hot-humid Saudi Arabian cities of Riyadh and Jeddah. The analysis utilizes a direct search optimization technique that is coupled to an hourly energy simulation program. Based on that, design guidelines are presented for the optimum thermal performance of mosques in these two cities in addition to other design and operating factors that need to be considered for mosques in general. © 2009 The Author(s).},

The freezing delay time of the smooth surfaces with roughness smaller than the size of the critical ice nuclei is found to be much longer than superhydrophobic surfaces with hierarchical structures. Experimental data and theoretical analysis show that the surface roughness plays a very crucial role in nucleation. The freezing delay time could not be extended further on rough surface with more superhydrophobic for sessile droplet. In addition, decreased roughness can increase the free energy barrier for heterogeneous nucleation, result in significant freezing delay. On the contrary, the freezing time from the start of nucleation to the completion of freezing increases with the contact angle. In addition, surfaces with hierarchical roughness are found to have the longest freezing time. © 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a new scheme of online accurate estimation of wheel-rail adhesion coefficient and optimal adhesion antiskid control of heavy-haul electric locomotives (HHEL) based on sliding mode and asymmetric barrier Lyapunov function (ABLF) theory. To achieve optimal adhesion control of the HHEL, it is necessary to precisely estimate the wheel-rail adhesion coefficient. However, the adhesion coefficient is difficult to be measured with a conventional physical sensor. The first novelty of this paper is to design a smart adhesion coefficient sensor based on sliding mode observer (SMO). The perception of the adhesion coefficient is transformed into the observation of load torque of the traction motors, and the wheel-rail adhesion coefficient is further calculated by using the load torque observed value. The HHEL achieves maximum traction from operating in the optimal adhesion point. However, wheel skidding is most likely to occur at this point. According to the changing trend of the adhesive coefficient characteristic curve, the operating state of a locomotive can be divided into two regions: The stable and skid regions. The second novelty of this paper is the adaptation of ABLF to guarantee that the HHEL operated at a stable region and the optimal adhesion antiskid control of HHEL is achieved. Finally, the simulation and experimental results verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.},

The running resistance is expressed in a general form by a second degree polynomial. The three terms in the polynomial are functions of these variables. The magnitude of the first term is speed independent and varies with number of axles, axle load, and type of track. The second term varies with speed and train length. No influence of axle load is distinguished. The third term is related to the air drag and varies with the speed squared and train configuration. It can be divided into two parts. One part is constant and depends upon the front and rear of the train, and another part increases approximately linearly with train length. JRRT89 © IMechE 2007.},

The water film has a thickness on the order of nanometers and results from the superposition of an existing quasi-liquid layer and additional surface water generated by frictional heat. When friction is measured as function of sliding velocity, the coefficients decrease according to the typical Stribeck behavior. However, for highest sliding velocities, it is still unknown whether friction decreases further or shows an increase due to viscous drag. Both tendencies are essential for the construction of safe bobsleighs and bobsleigh tracks. This contribution presents results of high-speed experiments up to 240 km/h for a steel slider on a disk of ice at different ice temperatures. In addition, using the friction model of Makkonen, friction coefficients were calculated as function of sliding velocity and ice temperature. The significant correlation between experimental results and model calculation supports the model conception of frictional melting and viscous shearing.},

This paper aims to investigate the compression strength of ice to facilitate the deicing equipment to crush ice. In this paper, a large-scale freezing laboratory is employed to simulate low-temperature environment, and the uniaxial unconfined compressive tests of artificial freshwater ice under different temperature conditions are carried out through the uniaxial loading system. The compressive strength and modulus of ice are obtained when the substrate is asphalt pavement. The test result shows that the ice compressive strength and modulus respectively distribute from 0.36 to 3.67 MPa and 11.7 to 359.1 MPa when ice temperature varies from −0.7 to −7.5°C. The relations between ice temperature and compressive strength are approximately in a linear manner, while the relation of compressive modulus and ice temperature shows good power function and exponential relationships, respectively, when ice temperature ranges from −8 to −5°C and from −5 to 0°C. Furthermore, the failure mechanism of ice under relatively lower temperature is due to the development of cut-through cracks inside the ice. The failure mode divides into shear failure and ductile failure and the failure ice is mainly composed of large ice strips and bulks. For the ice with relatively higher temperature especially the ice close to melting point temperature, the ice failure mode is compressive and ductile, and the failure ice is mainly composed of granular ice crystals.},

Natural lake ice samples of 8 cm by 8 cm in cross section and 20 cm high were used to investigate strain-rate dependence of uniaxial compressive strength and flaw effects on ice strength under moderate strain rates. The fracture modes of ice at moderate strain rates were also systematically investigated by using high-speed camera. It is found uniaxial compressive strength of natural lake ice increases with increasing strain-rate in the employed moderate strain-rate range. And natural flaws such as air bubble have a significant effect on uniaxial compressive strength of ice under moderate strain-rate, higher air content ice possesses lower compressive strength. Ice fracture mode depends on strainrate (or compressive velocity) of ice specimen, varying from splitting at strain rates lower than 10 s−1 to crushing at strain rates higher than 10 s−1. Ice specimen crushes into fine fragments may due to insufficient time for micro cracks to propagate, thus results in higher strength. In addition, dependence of compressive strength on strain-rate in a wide strain-rate range is also discussed.},

The foremost problem solved in this paper is the interoperability of various railway systems in the countries of the European Union. Thus, the immediate goal is to solve the problem of the interoperability of different railway systems used in the European Union. A distinction between railway track gauges (from 1435 to 1668 mm), particular couples of wagons, various clearances of rolling stock, different systems of infrastructure etc. are the main impediments. One of the problems in the nearest future will be the evaluation of the brakes of different wagons produced in Western Europe and the former Soviet Union. Freight trains in Lithuania consist of these two types of wagons, and therefore some problems of correcting the results of calculating braking distances and brake force may arise. The main object of this research is to investigate the methods evaluating the brakes of rolling-stock and to assess the possibilities of integrating and harmonizing these different methods. The reliability of the methods evaluating the brakes of rolling-stock is one of the most important components enabling the interoperability of railway transport in the EU network. The brakes of Russian wagons are calculated by MPS Rules for Traction Calculations, approved by the Russian Ministry of Transport (till 2004 - Ministry of Communication Ways of Russia)). On the other hand, the brakes of the wagons produced in Western Europe should be calculated applying TSI (Technical Specifications for Interoperability) methodology. The main parameter following TSI (Technical Specifications for Interoperability) methodology is braked mass and following MPS (Railway Transport Ministry of Russia) method - a pressing force of the brake shoes. The questions of determining the braked mass of wagons and correcting mean braking distance are presented. The compatibility of two different evaluating methods is discussed.

By means of full-scale testing and computer simulations, a parametric study is done showing which parameters are significant and their quantitative impact on energy usage. This is the aim of this study. The study shows that energy usage is sensitive to the driver's look forward distance, the braking ratio, and the degree of coasting. By planning the driving and making use of coasting it is possible to save 10-15\% in energy. If only unnecessary braking can be avoided, an energy saving of 5-7\% can be achieved. Combining the studied parameters results in an even greater save in energy. The running time is only slightly affected. The results show that in Sweden, and many other countries, there is an unused potential for saving energy. This possibility should be of interest to the train operators.

In this paper, the effect of different types of ice on the ice adhesion strength was investigated. The ice types precipitation ice, in-cloud ice and bulk water ice on the same aluminum substrate and under similar environmental conditions were investigated. The ice adhesion strength was measured with a centrifugal adhesion test and varied from 0.78 ± 0.10 MPa for precipitation ice, 0.53 ± 0.12 MPa for in-cloud ice to 0.28 ± 0.08 MPa for bulk water ice. The results indicate that the ice adhesion strength inversely correlates with the density of ice. The results inspire a new strategy in icephobic surface development, specifically tailored to the relevant ice type.},

Design/methodology/approach: This study examines the influence of the icing process, mechanism, temperature and freshwater/seawater on ice adhesion shear strength of carbon ceramic brake pads and puts forward a test method for the freshwater/seawater ice adhesion shear strength of amphibious aircraft brake pads. Findings: The obtained results examine the influence of the icing process, mechanism, temperature and freshwater/seawater on ice adhesion shear strength of carbon ceramic brake pads. The adhesion shear strength of frozen freshwater and of the seawater of Dalian, Qingdao, Fuzhou and Zhuhai on the surface of aircraft brake pads is measured at –10 to –50°C. It is found that the shear strength of freshwater increases first and then decreases with the decrease of temperature. The adhesion shear strength of seawater; however, increases mainly linear with the decrease of temperature. Originality/value: The value of this paper is that the test method proposed and test results for the freshwater/seawater ice adhesion shear strength of amphibious aircraft brake pads provide technical support for the anti-icing design of amphibious aircraft brake devices.},

Brake block friction characteristics along with traction-slip and running resistance characteristics for wagons and locomotives were used to estimate frictional heat generation rates at brake block-wheel and rail-wheel interfaces as a function of brake block type, brake load, number of wagons, tonnage per axle, nature of terrain (flat, uphill, downhill, etc.), train speed and time lag in braking. Braking performance was more consistent for cast iron brake blocks than that for composite brake blocks. Further, thermal loads on locomotive wheels were also lower for cast iron brake blocks, particularly with time lag in braking.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a new algorithm and a procedure for the efficient and accurate calculation of braking distances satisfying current safety Standards. One of these Standards is applied in ADIF (Spanish Railway Infrastructure Administrator), for instance, in the design of signalling systems, to locate signals and balises. Following the Standard, braking distance tables depend on the average gradient along that distance and the speed reduction. In practice, an initial slope is calculated over a forecasted braking distance along the railway track, so that if the corresponding braking distance given by the Standard highly differs from the initial one, it will be necessary to recalculate the average gradient and apply the Standard again. The manual application of this process may end up overestimating braking distances unnecessarily (as the Standard itself includes safety coefficients), falling into additional signalling costs and reducing the line capacity. This paper presents an iterative calculation procedure to adjust as much as possible the distance required by the Standard, so that the average gradient introduced into the Standard corresponds precisely with the braking distance where the average gradient has been computed. Furthermore, the algorithm improves the accuracy of the average gradient calculation, considering the slope transition curves instead of sharp slope vertices. The proposed algorithm has been implemented in a computer tool for its use in railway lines operated by ADIF, according to the braking distance current Standard (N.T.C.020.95). This tool incorporates a railways net model that allows the user to introduce a final braking point, a speed reduction, and provides automatically the kilometric line point where the brake should start. In addition, this tool provides a systematic procedure to obtain braking distances in the different technical departments of ADIF. This paper compares, in real cases, the non-assisted previous procedure with the application of the proposed one, showing the refined braking distances.},

	abstract = {The goal of this study is to integrate an air brake model with efficient algorithms for train longitudinal force calculation that are based on trajectory coordinate formulations. The air brake model, developed in this investigation and presented in this paper and a companion paper, consists of the locomotive automatic brake valve, air brake pipe and car control unit (CCU). The proposed air brake force model accounts for the effect of the air flow in long train pipes as well as the effect of leakage and branch pipe flows. This model can be used to study the dynamic behavior of the air flow in the train pipe and its effect on the longitudinal train forces during brake application and release. The governing equations of the air pressure flow are developed using the general fluid continuity and momentum equations, simplified using the assumptions of one-dimensional isothermal flow. Using these assumptions, one obtains two coupled air velocity/pressure partial differential equations that depend on time and the longitudinal coordinate of the brake pipes. The partial differential equations are converted to a set of first-order ordinary differential equations using the finite element method. The resulting air brake ordinary differential equations are solved simultaneously with the train's second-order non-linear dynamic differential equations of motion that are based on the trajectory coordinates. The train car non-linear dynamics is defined using a body track coordinate system that follows the car motion. The body track coordinate system translation and orientation are defined in terms of one parameter that describes the distance traveled by the car. The configuration of the car with respect to its track coordinate system is described using two translation coordinates and three Euler angles. The operation modes of the brake system considered in this investigation are the brake release mode and the brake application mode that includes service and emergency brakes. A detailed model of the locomotive automatic brake valve is presented in this investigation and used to define the inputs to the air brake pipe during the simulation. A simplified model of this valve is also proposed in order to reduce the computational time of the simulation. In a companion paper, the detailed CCU formulation is presented. The coupling between the air brake, locomotive automatic brake valve, CCUs and train equations is established and used in the companion paper in the simulation of the non-linear dynamics of long trains. The air brake formulations presented in the two companion papers are implemented in a computer code called Analysis of Train/Track Interaction Forces (ATTIF) which is developed for the analysis of longitudinal train forces. © IMechE 2012.},

While ice is technically a non-Newtonian fluid over long timescales, the authors suggest that it may be regarded as a low-density and low-strength rock, analogous to coal, for the practical purpose of ice excavation over short timescales. Three distinct ice-excavation techniques are reviewed: blasting, melting, and mechanical excavation, providing a case study of each. The authors summarize the unique advantages and disadvantages of each technique and conclude that an optimal open-ice-pit mining operation would most likely rely primarily on mechanical excavation and secondarily on blasting. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

Despite the fact that brakes must operate under a variety of environmental conditions, most standardized and developmental laboratory tests for brake materials are conducted under dry sliding conditions. Studies of wet braking behavior are rare in the tribology literature. The present work investigated the frictional behavior of commercial truck brake pad materials sliding on gray cast iron simulated brake discs in the presence of water films. An instrumented sub-scale testing machine equipped with a water spray was used. There was a significant effect of water films on reducing pad/disc friction compared with dry tests on the same materials and at the same sliding speeds. The friction coefficient under water spray conditions was inversely proportional to the square of the sliding speed. The reduction of friction with increasing speed was principally due to hydrodynamic effects, although the water spray also reduced frictional heating and changed the nature of the transfer film formation on the cast iron contact surface. Frictional recovery occurred within seconds after the water spray was removed. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In addition, influences of iron oxides, leaves and glycol/water mixtures on the coefficient of friction were also studied. The friction results are shown in the form of friction maps. Results indicate that iron oxides on the surfaces can prevent the samples from large friction reduction particularly at the low temperature. The friction mechanism is also discussed with the help of scanning electron microscopy photos.

The relationship between the microstructure and ductility of the materials and the tribology at the contacting surfaces was investigated. The study shows that during continuous sliding, pressure causes snow particles to melt into a liquid-like layer, encouraging the generation of oxide flakes on the contact path. The friction coefficient and wear rate are dramatically reduced through an oxidative friction and wear mechanism. In the absence of snow, the tribological process is controlled by the low temperature brittleness of steel in the temperature range from 3 °C to -15 °C. At these temperatures, cracks are prone to form and extend on the worn surfaces, resulting in the spalling of bulk scraps, which are crushed into debris that increases the friction coefficient and wear rate due to strong abrasion. When the temperature falls to -25 °C, an ice layer condenses on the metal surfaces and relaxes the tribological process in the same way as the added snow particles, which significantly decreases the friction and wear.},

Meanwhile, three types of damage mechanisms are proposed according to wear and rolling contact fatigue (RCF) behaviours under different temperature conditions: (a) room temperature (RT) damage mechanism, (b) ductile-brittle transition temperature (DBTT) damage mechanism, (c) below ductile-brittle transition temperature (BDBTT) damage mechanism. With the temperature decreasing from room to low temperature, the wear mechanism transforms from abrasive wear to adhesive wear and surface fatigue. Meanwhile, the rail material gradually becomes brittle and the subsurface damage at low temperature is more serious than that at room temperature. Furthermore, the subsurface damage at −15 °C is the worst. At low temperature, there is a wider size range of wear debris than that at room temperature.},

	abstract = {A pin-on-disc tribometer placed in a one-way ventilated chamber was used to investigate the effect of relative humidity on the tribology and airborne particle emission of three commercial railway brake block materials (grey cast iron, organic composite, and sintered). Cast iron showed the highest friction coefficient, particle emission and wear loss and organic composite exhibited the lowest. The generation of oxide layers on the worn cast iron surface resulted in a decrease in friction, particle emission and wear. Moisture adsorption by the organic composite leads to decreased friction coefficient and particle emission with increasing humidity. Relative humidity does not affect the friction coefficient of the sintered brake block, whose particle emission and wear loss significantly decline with increasing relative humidity.},

	abstract = {Non-uniform braking of wheel sets in locomotives and coaches/wagons can have disastrous consequences e.g. from wheel locking leading to derailments or thermal cracking, particularly under emergency braking conditions. Currently, while rigorous testing is used to characterize brake block characteristics and brake application time, no methods exist to determine the "variability" in braking across the different wheel sets, e.g. from differences in brake block characteristics, brake rigging, and performance of distributor valves. In this work, temperature rise in railway wheels is used to gauge normalized heat input coming in to wheels from braking. Two sets of field trial data are used to investigate variability of braking: (i) continuous rim temperature data for locomotive wheels and (ii) one time measurement of wheel rim temperatures of all wheels. The data is used to pin point the causes for non-uniformity in braking and to characterize the extent of non-uniformity. Non-uniformity in braking is found to be particularly severe in freight trains as compared to passenger trains. Faulty distributor valves are seen to result in maximum braking effort on wheels that is as high as seven times that of average braking effort in freight trains.},

The results showed that the average friction coefficient increased with increasing braking force. The effect of external hard particles on the friction coefficient varied with the braking speed. When the speed was less than 160 km/h, the friction coefficient increased with increasing speed. When the speed was more than 160 km/h, the external hard particles did not have an obvious effect on the friction coefficient. It was also found that the decline in transmission efficiency of the clamp in severely low temperatures and wet conditions was due to the clamp being covered with snow and becoming difficult to reset, which in turn reduced the clearance of the brake disk and brake blocks. In such a situation, external hard particles or contact between the brake block and disc would result in scratches on the brake disk surface. The research showed that braking for 1 min after every 7 min interval could remove the ice on the brake disk surface and prevent the clamp from being frozen in ice.},

	abstract = {In this report the effect of brake block materials, position and shape on wheel wear is investigated in detail by analysing the equivalent conicity levels, wear rates, wear profiles and hardness profiles of wheels and blocks. The equivalent conicity levels of all the wagons in the EuropeTrain have the tendency to increase with the mileage. For wagons with C952-1 the increase of conicity is twice as fast as for wagons with cast iron. Wagons with IB116* Combi have EC levels which are almost comparable to wagons with cast iron. Wagons with IB116* have slightly higher equivalent conicities. Apart from the brake block material, also wagon type, loop and loading conditions have strong impact on the development of equivalent conicity. This is usually accompanied with a comparable influence on the wheel wear rate. All LL-block types result in higher wheel wear rates than cast iron blocks. In most cases a kind of hollow wear of the running surface occurs, which increases the EC level. Wheel profile degradation of wagons with C952-1 are compared to those of wagons with cast iron blocks, it shows that the higher EC levels of wagons with C952-1 are mainly caused by the higher surface wear, rather than a strong deviating wear pattern. Remarkable is that the wagons with IB116* Combi blocks have low equivalent conicity values in spite of their high wheel wear rates, due to the very uniform wear pattern. Concerning the effect of the modified block position, a little beneficial influence on the EC levels can be seen. It might be possible that the modified block position has a positive influence on equivalent conicity levels but no statistical reliable conclusion can be drawn. It has to be taken into account that further analysis of the brake block position on wagons showed that the objective, to shift the position of the brake block 5 mm to the inner side of the flange is only partly obtained. Concerning the effect of the modified block shape on the wheel wear of the Hbbillns wagons, no significant influence on EC levels nor wear patterns can be seen. It can be seen that the bedding in period of the blocks on these wagons has been quite short in the test. After the first run, the profiles of the normal and modified (machined) brake blocks are already comparable and adapted to the wheel profile. Reference:},

	abstract = {Scraped surface heat exchangers (SSHEs) are commonly used in the food, chemical, and pharmaceutical industries for heat transfer, crystallization, and other continuous processes. They are ideally suited for products that are viscous, sticky, that contain particulate matter, or that need some degree of crystallization. Since these characteristics describe a vast majority of processed foods, SSHEs are especially suited for pumpable food products. During operation, the product is brought in contact with a heat transfer surface that is rapidly and continuously scraped, thereby exposing the surface to the passage of untreated product. In addition to maintaining high and uniform heat exchange, the scraper blades also provide simultaneous mixing and agitation. Heat exchange for sticky and viscous foods such as heavy salad dressings, margarine, chocolate, peanut butter, fondant, ice cream, and shortenings is possible only by using SSHEs. High heat transfer coefficients are achieved because the boundary layer is continuously replaced by fresh material. Moreover, the product is in contact with the heating surface for only a few seconds and high temperature gradients can be used without the danger of causing undesirable reactions. SSHEs are versatile in the use of heat transfer medium and the various unit operations that can be carried out simultaneously.

	abstract = {An important option for increasing the efficiency in Concentrated Solarthermal Power (CSP) is the development of systems generating steam directly in the solar field. To produce dispatchable and affordable electrical power, the integration of an efficient and economical thermal energy storage is an attractive option. To (dis)charge a storage with steam, latent heat storages are particularly suitable for the use with two-phase heat transfer media. Due to low heat conductivities of the phase change materials, the heat exchanger design is crucial. Up to now no latent storage is commercially deployed in CSP. A new latent storage approach is being developed at Fraunhofer ISE; a Screw Heat Exchanger (SHE) is employed for heat transfer. With a SHE, material can be transported during the phase change. With this innovative concept, the size of the heat transfer area and the storage capacity can be decoupled and it seems possible to develop an economically viable latent storage.To understand the dynamics of the phase change and the heat transfer characteristics in the SHE, testing will be done with a laboratory prototype. The phase change material (PCM) used is an eutectic mixture of NaNO3 and KNO3 with a melting point at Tm=221°C. It is a salt mixture with low price and high availability, as is the requirement for the development of a low cost thermal energy storage.A proof of concept for the storage concept has been obtained. The problematic crystallization process in the SHE was successfully performed. A thermal power of Q=. 11. kW was transferred to a salt mass flow of about 50. kg/h. It showed the feasibility of the transport of a PCM during the phase change due to the self-cleaning effect of the screws. The heat exchanger has been designed, constructed and equipped with measurement devices. Peripheral transport components have been selected to allow semi-automated storage operation. The storage system will be tested to gain experience for the design of process equipment necessary for the eventual use in large scale solarthermal power plants. Parallel to the commissioning, the heat exchanger design was assessed and improved. The heat transfer characteristics of the storage is dependent on parameters as the PCM mass flow, the rotational speed of the screw shafts, the temperature difference of PCM to the heat transfer media, the inclination of the heat exchanger and the granule size. The correlation between these factors will be examined in further experiments to assess their influence on operation strategies. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Thermal energy storage systems provide a means to store energy for use in heating and cooling applications at a later time. The storage of thermal energy allows renewable sources of energy to be stored if the time of demand does not coincide with the time of production. It also enables access to off-peak electricity tariffs offered during times of low electricity demand. Storage systems can be charged during the low-cost tariff period and provide heating or cooling later when required. This benefits consumers with lower electricity costs and power generators with demand levelling. Thermal energy storage systems predominantly store heat as sensible heat in a substance. However, during a phase change heat energy can be stored as latent heat. Phase change material (PCM) thermal storage systems can store a greater amount of thermal energy per unit volume than sensible heat storage systems. Historically a drawback of using PCMs as a storage medium has been the low rates of heat transfer. Heat transfer enhancement techniques studied have included the use of additional metallic material and increasing heat transfer surface area such as fins to improve heat transfer rates of the PCM. Although these techniques are effective, they add significant cost and reduce the compactness factor of the thermal energy storage system. Recent research has been conducted on heat transfer enhancement that makes use of moving or transporting the PCM. This method is not only effective for increasing the heat transfer; it is less expensive and maintains a high compactness factor for the thermal energy storage system. This review paper presents the different heat transfer enhancement techniques reported in the literature. It also summarises the research conducted on phase change storage systems where the PCM is moved in the storage system.},

	abstract = {In this paper we report the first direct measurements of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in the UK using a vehicle emission remote sensing technique. Measurements of NO, NO2 and ammonia (NH3) from almost 70,000 vehicles were made spanning vehicle model years from 1985 to 2012. These measurements were carefully matched with detailed vehicle information data to understand the emission characteristics of a wide range of vehicles in a detailed way. Overall it is found that only petrol fuelled vehicles have shown an appreciable reduction in total NOx emissions over the past 15-20 years. Emissions of NOx from diesel vehicles, including those with after-treatment systems designed to reduce emissions of NOx, have not reduced over the same period of time. It is also evident that the vehicle manufacturer has a strong influence on emissions of NO2 for Euro 4/5 diesel cars and urban buses. Smaller-engined Euro 4/5 diesel cars are also shown to emit less NO2 than larger-engined vehicles. It is shown that NOx emissions from urban buses fitted with Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) are comparable to those using Exhaust Gas Recirculation for Euro V vehicles, while reductions in NOx of about 30\% are observed for Euro IV and EEV vehicles. However, the emissions of NO2 vary widely dependent on the bus technology used. Almost all the NOx emission from Euro IV buses with SCR is in the form of NO, whereas EEV vehicles (Enhanced Environmentally friendly Vehicle) emit about 30\% of the NOx as NO2. We find similarly low amounts of NO2 from trucks (3.5-12t and {\textgreater}12t). Finally, we show that NH3 emissions are most important for older generation catalyst-equipped petrol vehicles and SCR-equipped buses. The NH3 emissions from petrol cars have decreased by over a factor of three from the vehicles manufactured in the late 1990s compared with those manufactured in 2012. Tablesof emission factors are presented for NOx, NO2 and NH3 together with uncertainties to assist the development of new emission inventories. © 2013 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Ag/SBA‐15 catalysts with different Ag contents were prepared by an impregnation method and were used for the gas‐phase selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde with O2 as the oxidant. These catalysts were characterized using N2 adsorption‐desorption, X‐ray diffraction, scan‐ ning electron microscopy, high‐resolution transmission electron microscopy, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, and X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The effects of Ag loading, reac‐ tion temperature, and weight hourly space velocity of benzyl alcohol on the catalytic performance were investigated. The results showed that Ag was successfully incorporated into the mesoporous channels of SBA‐15 and well dispersed on the surface as a result of the nano‐confinement effect of SBA‐15, which increased the specific surface area of the active components. Moreover, Ag/SBA‐15 had a uniform pore size, a wall of thickness of 3–5 nm, and a high specific surface area of 411–541 m2 /g. The catalytic activity of Ag/SBA‐15 for the gas‐phase selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde was enhanced by oxygen spillover of nucleophilic oxygen species from the Ag nano‐ particles to the SBA‐15 surface. The 5.3\%Ag/SBA‐15 exhibited excellent low‐temperature catalytic properties; when the reaction temperature was 220 °C, the conversion of benzyl alcohol and the selectivity for benzaldehyde reached 87\% and 95\%, respectively. At 240 °C, the catalyst displayed the best catalytic properties, achieving a benzyl alcohol conversion of 94\% and benzaldehyde selec‐ tivity of 97\%, which remained almost constant at 240–300 °C. This showed that Ag/SBA‐15 had excellent thermal gradient stability. The catalyst could be used for 40 h and retained high catalytic activity for oxidation after treatment at 500 °C.},

Additional tests were also performed on one of the test vehicles over the World Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Cycle (WLTC) according to the Global Technical Regulation No. 15 test procedure. The focus was on regulated exhaust emissions; both legislative (CVS-bag) and modal (continuous) analyses of the following gases were performed: CO (carbon monoxide), THC (total hydrocarbons), CH4 (methane), NMHC (non-methane hydrocarbons), NOx (oxides of nitrogen) and CO2 (carbon dioxide). Furthermore, unregulated exhaust emissions were also examined in certain cases: particle number and mass, as well as emissions of NH3 (ammonia), NO (nitrogen monoxide) and NO2 (nitrogen dioxide). The results showed a range of differences in terms of regulated emissions, particulate matter and ammonia emissions, and also in the composition of the NOx in the exhaust gas (i.e. the NO:NO2 ratio). Emissions of both CO2 and particulates were markedly lower when running on CNG. Emissions from the two phases of the NEDC and the four phases of the WLTC were briefly analysed.},

The thermal energy storage involves a shell and tube arrangement where paraffin wax as phase change material (PCM) is filled in the shell. Water as heat transfer fluid (HTF) is passed inside the tube for both charging and discharging cycles. According to the conservation of energy, a simple numerical method called alternative iteration between thermal resistance and temperature has been developed for the analysis of heat transfer between the PCM and HTF during charging and discharging cycles. Experimental arrangement has been designed and built to examine the physical validity of the numerical results. Comparison between the numerical predictions and the experimental data shows a good agreement. A detailed parametric study is also carried out for various flow parameters and system dimensions such as different mass flow rates, inlet temperatures of HTF, tube thicknesses and radii. Numerical study reveals that the contribution of the inlet temperature of HTF has much influence than mass flow rate in terms of storage operating time and HTF outlet temperature. Tube radius is a more important parameter than thickness for better heat transfer between HTF and PCM. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Different from traditional organic (paraffin or non-parafin) or inorganic phase change slurries, MPCS is able to maintain both high latent heat capacity and heat transfer rate under controlled volume changes and safe operation conditions. Consequently, in recent decade, MPCS has been widely proposed and tested in textile, building, cooling and heating, solar and thermal storage systems, etc. Based on those recent findings and application developments, characterizations of thermal and hydrodynamic properties for MPCS are made in this study. The basic objective of this paper is to summarize the features of MPCS properties and the establishment of models for MPCS properties and morphologies. The review and analysis are based on recent representative experimental studies, which are categorized into: properties, heat transfer characteristics, stability and applications. Due to the various materials and methods and carry fluids properties, no single model can cover the properties for all MPCS. In this study, each property is reviewed with its specific model and application regions. Basic trends are compared with other kinds of phase change materials. Finally, by investigating those results the future trends of MPCS are presented. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The necessary amount of fins is directly coupled to the capacity of the storage system, what makes larger systems expensive. The PCMflux concept is developed in order to realize both a controllable and a possibly more cost effectivelatent heat storage system. These aims are addressed by separating the storage material from the heat exchanger. As a result, the PCM can be moved over the heat exchanger. The PCM thereby is macroencapsulated into containers. These pass the heat exchanger while the PCM inside changes phase. In order to improve thermal contact between containers and heat exchanger, Hitec® as an intermediate fluid is used to avoid poor dry contact. In this article,an experimental setup is described to examine the heat transfer through thin layers of molten Hitec®. The results of the experiments show an increased heat transfer by a factor of 9.9. This improves feasibility of the PCMflux concept significantly.},

	abstract = {Effective and economic storage solutions have an important role to enable Solar Thermal Electricity plants (STE) to generate dispatchable power. A thermal storage can increase the value of STE by providing firm electricity in times of peak load or ancillary services. Latent storages are suited optimally for direct steam generating STE systems: due to the isothermal behavior of the phase change materials (PCM) during melting /crystallization, exergy losses during storage charging/discharging are minimized. Up to now latent heat storages are, due to technical and economic issues, not used commercially in STE systems. The PCM have a very low heat conductivity - therefore a sophisticated heat exchanger design is needed to build such storages with sufficient charging/discharging power. An innovative storage concept, uses a screw heat exchanger to transport the PCM from a cold to a hot tank or vice versa during phase change. This concept separates heat exchange and storage tanks.Existing concepts do not have this ability. In annual yield calculations the use of this heat exchanger as part of a thermal storage in a 50 MWel direct steam generating solar thermal power plant has been assessed. After setting up of a cost structure, the respective levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) have been used as comparison criterion for two storage systems with different designs. It can be shown, that a storage system with three storage tanks yields lower LCOE than one with two storage tanks. There is further potential for cost reductions, such as the optimization of the heat exchanger area and the temperature difference between the heat transfer fluid and the PCM.},

The heat transfer mechanisms during the charging and discharging periods of the phase change materials (PCMs) and two basic problems for phase transformations have been discussed in this paper. 1D, 2D and 3D popular mathematical solutions based on the heat transfer mechanisms of conduction and/or convection have been analyzed. Then, various numerical models for encapsulated PCMs in terms of macro-encapsulated PCM and micro-encapsulated PCM were investigated. The numerical simulation of heat transfer problems in phase change processes is complicated and the achieved results are approximate according to a number of conditions. The accuracy of numerical solution depends on the assumptions that are made by the authors.

	abstract = {The increasing share of renewables in today's generation mix and the accompanying fluctuation in generation requires large scale as well as decentralized storage capacities to secure grid stability. In the described power-to-heat concept, electricity, produced from PV-plants or small scale wind farms, is used to heat up high temperature latent heat storages. The heat can be used in industrial processes. The storage is equipped with electrical heating elements, directly immerged into the phase change material to achieve best conversion efficiency. Discharging takes place by an oil cooled plate heat exchanger. For heat transfer enhancement during discharging, a concept, using moving blades to scrape off the solidifying material, was developed. With this method, the solidified layer of phase change material on the heat exchanger surface is kept at constant thickness, allowing for constant heat flux during the major period of the discharging process. Feasibility of the concept with moving scrapers was demonstrated, proving the advantages over the passive concept. Various aspects have been identified for improvement of the concept. In the second generation design it is intended to combine the electrical heating with the cooling plate to minimize the amount of components and material inside the storage and to maximize the available heat exchanger surface. With this solution, the same heat exchanger surface can be used for charging or discharging. Flat heat exchanger surfaces will allow a very narrow gap between scraper and heat exchanger plate. The mounting of the scraper mechanism is changed from a central slide to a portal frame, supported by four ball bearings. Two bearings each are guided in a track on each sides of the storage. For exact positioning in relation to the cooling plates, two bearings each are mounted in the middle of the traversal trusses, and guided along the middle track. The scraper is re-designed to also be able to scrape off solidifying salt at the bottom of the storage. In addition investigation are under way, to reduce the adhesion between PCM and heat exchanger surface by nanotechnology or any other means.},

However, the relative importance of each vehicle type with respect to SOA formation remains unclear due to conflicting evidence from recent laboratory, field, and modeling studies. Both are likely important, with evolving contributions that vary with location and over short time scales. This review summarizes evidence, research needs, and discrepancies between top-down and bottom-up approaches used to estimate SOA from motor vehicles, focusing on inconsistencies between molecular-level understanding and regional observations. The effect of emission controls (e.g., exhaust aftertreatment technologies, fuel formulation) on SOA precursor emissions needs comprehensive evaluation, especially with international perspective given heterogeneity in regulations and technology penetration. Novel studies are needed to identify and quantify "missing" emissions that appear to contribute substantially to SOA production, especially in gasoline vehicles with the most advanced aftertreatment. Initial evidence suggests catalyzed diesel particulate filters greatly reduce emissions of SOA precursors along with primary aerosol. (Figure Presented).},

Exhaust was photochemically oxidized in a flow reactor to determine the ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3) aerosol formation potential from vehicles of gasoline, diesel and liquid petroleum gasoline (LPG) fuel types. Secondary formation of aerosol NH4NO3, was larger than primary emissions for all vehicle fuel types except diesel, for which negligible secondary NH4NO3production was observed. Although diesel vehicles emitted more primary nitrogen oxides than other vehicle types, ammonia emitted from gasoline and liquid petroleum gasoline fuels types limited the secondary production of NH4NO3.

Pho-tochemistry is simulated using a set of 40 UV lights (to-tal power 4 KW). Characterisation of the emission spec-trum of these lights shows that atmospheric aging of emissions may be simulated over a range of tempera-tures (−7 to 25 • C). A photolysis rate of NO 2 , J NO 2 , of (8.0 ± 0.7) × 10 −3 s −1 was determined at 25 • C. We demon-strate the utility of this new system by presenting results on the aging (OH = 12 × 10 6 cm −3 h) of emissions from a modern (Euro 5) gasoline car operated during a driving cy-cle (New European Driving Cycle, NEDC) on a chassis dy-namometer in a vehicle test cell. Emissions from the entire NEDC were sampled and aged in the chamber. Total or-ganic aerosol (OA; primary organic aerosol (POA) emission + secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation) was (369.8– 397.5)10 −3 g kg −1 fuel, or (13.2–15.4) × 10 −3 g km −1 , after aging, with aged OA/POA in the range 9–15. A thorough investigation of the composition of the gas phase emissions suggests that the observed SOA is from previously uncon-sidered precursors and processes. This large enhancement in particulate matter mass from gasoline vehicle aerosol emis-sions due to SOA formation, if it occurs across a wider range of gasoline vehicles, would have significant implications for our understanding of the contribution of on-road gasoline ve-hicles to ambient aerosols.},

Reductions in oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emissions ranged from 21\% in Denver (from 5.6 ± 1.3 to 4.4 ± 0.2 g of NOx/kg of fuel) to 43\% in Tulsa (from 4.4 ± 0.3 to 2.5 ± 0.1 g of NOx/kg of fuel) since 2005, while decreases in fleet ammonia (NH3) emissions ranged from no change in Denver (from 0.45 ± 0.09 to 0.44 ± 0.02 g of NH3/kg of fuel) since 2005 to a 28\% decrease in LA (from 0.80 ± 0.02 to 0.58 ± 0.02 g of NH3/kg of fuel) since 2008. The majority of the reduction in gasoline vehicle NOx emissions occurred prior to the full implementation of the Tier II emission standards in 2009. High in-use NOx emissions from small-engine diesel passenger vehicles produced a significant contribution to the fleet means despite their small numbers. NH3 emissions decreased at a slower rate than NOx emissions as a result of modest NH3 emission reduction among the newest vehicles and increased emissions from a growing number of older vehicles with active catalytic converters. In addition, the reactive nitrogen emissions from many new model year vehicles are now dominated by NH3.},

	abstract = {A crystallite-scale model that explicitly accounts for the diffusion of stored NOx in the storage phase is used to explain the effects of cycle time, Pt dispersion and loading on NOx conversion and NH3 selectivity on low Pt dispersion NOx storage/reduction (NSR) catalysts. The low Pt dispersion or aged NSR catalysts are known to give high selectivity to NH3 which is essential for the combined NSR/SCR (selective catalytic reduction) system. It is shown through both experiments and modeling that for a fixed ratio of the moles of NO:H2 fed per cycle, a longer diluted rich feed for fixed lean time and a shorter overall cycle is beneficial in terms of NOx conversion for both 3\% and 8\% dispersion catalysts. Model predicts that more stored NOx is allowed to diffuse back to the Pt sites during a longer diluted regeneration while excessive NOx slip is prevented in a shorter overall cycle due to frequent regeneration, both of which leads to higher NOx conversion. The NH3 selectivity which depends on local NO:H2 ratio decreased with increase (decrease) in rich time (total cycle time) for 8\% catalyst. Similar NH3 selectivity trend as a function of overall cycle time was also observed for 3\% catalyst. The findings are helpful in assessing the viability of these catalysts (3\% and 8\%) to be used in conjunction with the SCR catalyst. Finally, the model is also used to gain additional insights on the impact of Pt loading and dispersion to provide important guidelines for NSR catalyst design for combined NSR/SCR application. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

The thermal energy storage unit involves a triplex concentric tube with phase change material (PCM) filling in the middle channel, with hot heat transfer fluid (HHTF) flowing outer channel during charging process and cold heat transfer fluid (CHTF) flowing inner channel during discharging process. A simple numerical method according to conversation of energy, called temperature \& thermal resistance iteration method has been developed for the analysis of PCM solidification and melting in the triplex concentric tube. To test the physical validity of the numerical results, an experimental apparatus has been designed and built by which the effect of the inlet temperature and the flow rate of heat transfer fluid (HTF, including HHTF and CHTF) on the thermal energy storage has been studied. Comparison between the numerical predictions and the experimental data shows good agreement. Graphical results including fluid temperature and interface of solid and liquid phase of PCM versus time and axial position, time-wise variation of energy stored/released by the system were presented and discussed. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The use of PCM heat storage to compensate for temperature peaks that may occur offer significant savings in time-dependent thermal management in the aforementioned products. The aim of this paper was to obtain physical validation of the numerical results produced using FEMLAB. This validation was obtained through a comparison of experimental data and numerical results. The numerical methods studied were an enthalpy method and an effective heat capacity method. An ensemble of experimental PCM storages, with and without heat transfer enhancement structures, was designed and constructed. The numerical predictions calculated with FEMLAB simulation software were compared to experimental data. Both numerical methods gave good estimations for the temperature distribution of the storages in both the melting and freezing processes. However, the effective heat capacity method, which used a narrower temperature range, dT=2 °C, was the most precise numerical method when the numerical results were compared to the experimental results. © 2003 Elsevier SAS.

PHV1 resulted in lower emissions than HV2 due to the pure electric strategy used by the former. PHV1 and HV2 showed lower regulated emissions than conventional Euro 5 gasoline light duty vehicles.

	abstract = {Vehicular emissions of reactive nitrogen compounds (RNCs) such as nitric oxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and ammonia (NH3) have a substantial impact on urban air quality. NO and NO2support the photochemical formation of ozone, and NH3is involved in the atmospheric formation of secondary aerosols. Vehicular NO is mainly formed during combustion, whereas NO2and NH3are both secondary pollutants of the catalytic converter systems. Herein we report on tail-pipe RNC emissions of gasoline-fueled Euro-3- and Euro-4-passenger cars at transient driving from 0 to 150 km h-1. Two sets of 10 in-use vehicles with comparable engine size and mileage were studied with time-resolved chemical ionization-mass spectrometry (CI-MS). Each vehicle was tested in 7 different driving cycles including the legislative European (EDC) and the US FTP-75 driving cycles. Mean emission factors (EFs) for different traffic situations are reported and effects of cold start, velocity, acceleration, and deceleration are discussed. Furthermore, critical operating conditions supporting the de novo formation of NH3have been identified. In the EDC, mean NO- and NH3-EFs of 57±26 and 16±12 mg km-1were obtained for Euro-3-vehicles; those of the Euro-4-technology were lower by about 25\% and 33\% at the levels of 43±46 and 10±7 mg km-1, respectively. NO2emissions of the investigated three-way catalyst (TWC) vehicles accounted for {\textless}1\% of the detected RNCs, whereas NH3was found to be the dominant RNC for most vehicle conditions. Molar NH3proportions varied from about 0.4-0.8, as soon as catalyst light-off occurred. NO was found in large excess only during the cold-start period. Catalyst light-off is indicated by a fast transition from NO- to NH3-rich exhaust. Velocity and acceleration had pronounced effects on the RNC emission characteristics. Mean velocity-dependent EFs for NO and NH3varied by about one order of magnitude from 10 to 74 and 15 to 161 mg km-1for Euro-3-vehicles and from 12 to 44 and 7 to 144 mg km-1for the Euro-4 fleet. We conclude that the investigated Euro-3- and Euro-4-vehicles are mainly operated under slightly reducing conditions, where the NH3emissions dominate over those of the NO. Under these conditions, both vehicle fleets on an average fulfilled the valid Euro-3 and Euro-4 limits for nitrogen oxides (NOx) of 150 and 80 mg km-1, respectively (as NO2equivalents). © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
